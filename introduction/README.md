# Introduction
COVID-19 has changed the way we work and live, and let's take a minute to talk about freelancing.
 
It's not for everyone, many people currently are being forced into a workspace they don't enjoy day after day, additionally with limited communication via Skype, Zoom, etc, it's not an ideal situation. So let's start with the first job you
 
How does the money work?
 
Let's start with the first job or the worst job you have ever had.
 
Let's talk about what kind of person is the right fit for freelancing.
 
How to be an UX Designer in 2022 (Freelancer Edition)
 
What does a UX Portfolio look like?
 
First off we need to get the portfolio in front of the person who makes the decision. If the portfolio doesn't get in front of the person how will they know that this portfolio exists. So there needs to be a level of visibility that is overcome  for any portfolio good or bad to be seen.
 
How this visibility is solved could be a numbers game, eventually you will be seen if you apply to enough places, etc, etc.
 
After that it's about the portfolio, even if you are able to get your stuff in front of people, let's say you have a lot of connections you are constantly able to get your portfolio in front of directors hands, but when they see the portfolio is of subpar quality. Or maybe your portfolio is subpar so even with connections you are afraid of showing your portfolio to people because it's not good enough.
 
So the question is for UX Designers, is the portfolio good enough?
 
A portfolio should be at least 3 pieces to maybe 5 pieces, sometimes 6 pieces in length.
 
For a student portfolio it's pretty obvious because most of it will be unpaid work, or conceptual work, or class assignments, etc.
 
For Professional Portfolio it will be of paid work, or work done for a client, etc. Maybe a mix.
 
What are some PROs and CONs
 
Independent Contractor/Freelancer/Remote
 
Being an UX Designer is in an unique position to not only be one of the few jobs in tech related fields to be remote, but maybe over 6 figures. But working remotely as an independent Contractor and Freelancer can give you even more freedom, but there are a few things that are PROs and CONs.
 
If you are someone who is able to get clients you can be an independent Contractor. It is as simple as that. Unless you are able to get Clients which are where the stream of income is coming from, you will not make it as a freelancer.
 
Also working with clients can be a hassle or a pleasant experience, mainly tho depending on where the source of the clients are from you have a mostly negative experience, but with the right filters in place you may be surprised.
 
Some positives are that you are less tied to a rigid system and in some ways it really is having your fate in your own hands. Although at the workplace working with many people we have slack to be able to cover for each other, being able to be free and make your own choices is a liberating feeling that maybe is an unique experience that is outside of the typical 9-5 workplace setting.
 
You can make money but prepare to be tired and overworked, and end up hating clients. So that's why it is important to have the correct infrastructure in place before getting too many clients, in fact even before getting one.
 
It can be simple things such as just getting things in order,
 
But also let's talk about how to file taxes and how to file for deductibles, etc.
 
How much do I need to make per month?
 
What kind of lifestyle are you trying to live?
 
Covid-19, most people who work at the workplace aren't having the greatest workplace experience either.
 
Is the home office the new workplace?
 
I am not sure but being an UX Designer is a role that can be filled at a home office, and I think regardless of the workplace, to be able to make over 6 figures as a UX Designers requires the person to be worked hard and it's competitive to get 6 figures.
 
It might be competitive just to keep a job or get a job, so it will be tough regardless. As a freelancer you can get multiple clients and have multiple streams of income, so if one day a client falls out then you will still have a part of your income.
 
Also you are your own boss and make your own hours.
 
But as a UX Designer, are you just by yourself or is there a team?
 
If there is a team, where can I get help
 
What is it like hiring a virtual assistant to make calls and make appointments.
 
How do I streamline making appointments?
 
How do I write contracts, how do I make sure clients take my contracts seriously.
 
How do I vet my clients?
 
How do I call my clients? This is a make or break kind of situation, if you are able to make calls and close deals then you will not have a problem being a freelancer.
 
Sometimes this is skipped or happens less often, but these are also good opportunities. to sell more services or add more features, or increase prices.
 
But most of this also can be done over email, sometimes clients will prefer only email and you may never get a call from them.

The call
 
This is going to have to be the thing that you will have to get used to as someone who is trying to do remote work. If you are someone who is trying to get into a more remote role, there will eventually be a call.
 
Let's say people have been getting the applications or emails and you start getting emails from responses, or rejection emails as well.
 
But slowly there will be people that start calling in, and when this starts happening it's when you know it's on.
 
So pick up the phone and start taking calls.
 
Sometimes you schedule ahead of time with a potential client, sometimes they want to do it over skype.
 
But there will be a call eventually, or sometimes a relationship can be done completely over email. It really depends on the client, and it's better to let the client lead.
 
But when taking these calls make sure to one have everything on a seperate line. Do not send these out to a personal number because one day you won't be able to turn the phone off without losing the ability to contact friends and family. So get a business number and start using that number for calls.
 
Start role playing, make it an experience to get to know the designer, treat them as stakeholders, sometimes there will be multiple people that are working on the team.
 
Get things to help scheduling
