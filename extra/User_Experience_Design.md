# Chapter 3: User Experience Design
## User Experience Design (UX)

User Experience (UX) : The overall experience of interacting with the machine > computer > UI, as well as what types of objectives that the User should accomplish during the interaction. Starts with design thinking methodology from IBM, Empathy, Ideate, Define, Prototype, Test. Starts with using empathy to understand what a particular user may be experiencing up to the point of contact with the machine, an understanding of the headspace, mentalities, biases, and feelings that a particular user may have even before they come in contact with the machine. Ideation of what kind of user this User Interface should be designed for, mind maps to get a full scope of the concepts that could be relavant to a particular use case. Create a Persona, fictional person based on the research on the Target Demographic or hypothetical User, based on the ideation and/or based on the User Research, target demographic. Journey Maps to scope the full path of a particular user along the journey of navigating an User Interface and the various methods of Interactions with the User Interface in that journey. Designing hypthetical Scenarios to start creating Tasks that the Persona will accomplish during their navigation in the User Interface. Testing to prove hyptothesis of how Users interact with the Interface. Revamped Double Diamond is a good place to start when thinking about User Research. In first diamond, discover and then define the problem. Thinking Divergingly and then converging to a hypothesis and stragety. During the Second Diamond, develop and deliver. Again thinking diverging and then converging to the solution. Collecting data using forms and/or User Interviews to get quantitative as well as qualitative data on various parts of the User Experience Design process. Implementing what was learned into the User Experience.

# The way of the UX/UI designer**

*User experience* (UX) is a term that is becoming increasingly common as more industries start to recognize the value and impact that good UX design can provide. With so many options available to end users, companies can no longer afford to ignore the user experience of their products. A frustrating or confusing user experience will lead to the loss of customers and will directly affect earnings.

But what is user experience design? How does it differ from user experience research or interaction design? It can be confusing to sort through all of the information available on UX, particularly since it is a constantly evolving term that is applied broadly in various contexts.

# **Getting started with UX design**

In his classic book *The Elements of User Experience*, author Jesse James Garrett conceptualizes the five planes of UX as parts of an iceberg. He explores their varying levels of complexity and how they build on each other.

The bottom of the iceberg is *research* and *strategy*. A UX designer begins by gathering all of the information that they can about the user for whom they are designing a product. Their goal is to understand the problem thoroughly before starting to design a solution. The next plane of the iceberg is *scope*. In this plane, a UX designer's goal is to translate user needs and business objectives into specific requirements for the content and functionality that the product will offer to users. *Structure* refers to the site map, which is an organized hierarchy and flow of pages on a site. Next is *skeleton*, which is composed of wireframes. These are the concept sketches that are presented before the designer invests too much detail or effort. And finally, *surface*, or visual design, is the interface that the user will interact with.

# **Defining UX design**

*User experience* can be defined as the overall experience of a person using a product or service, such as a website or a computer app. User experience is especially concerned with how easy the product or service is to use.

A user experience designer has a challenging and complex role; they act as a valuable liaison between different departments and team members. User experience is often used as a general term that refers to multiple disciplines, so job descriptions may vary widely based on the skill set and focus that an employer is searching for.

It's important to learn the skills and components of UX. Below is an overview of many of the key areas that you will be exploring in this program. Don't get too bogged down with trying to memorize and deeply understand them at this point. For now, you'll focus on beginning to build your awareness of these areas. You will develop and apply them in future checkpoints.

# **Key components and core skills of UX**

### As you review these skills, begin to take notes for yourself about what excites you. The joy of the UX/UI field is the wide variety of options that you will have. Explore the domains that light you up. Think about what propensities you have now and what new skills you might want to acquire.

- **Research and analysis:** Before ever designing a screen or interface, it's important to understand the problem being solved and figure out who the users are. Gathering requirements is a part of the beginning of every project.
- **Information architecture:** Information architecture encompasses structural design, organization, and labeling of websites, intranets, mobile applications, and social media software. Information architecture aims to organize content so that it is easy to find and use.
- **Content strategy:** Content strategy refers to satisfying business requirements through content creation and distribution. This includes the words on the page as well as the images and multimedia.
- **Wireframing:** A wireframe is a simple illustration of a page's interface. It focuses on the layout, content, function, and behavior. Wireframes should be quick to make and quick to revise, so they do not typically include any styling, color, or graphics.
- **Prototyping:** A prototype is a preliminary version or draft of a product that allows a user to click through the product. It simulates how the software will work before money and time is invested in developing the actual product. A prototype can be either low fidelity with linked-together wireframes, or high fidelity with pixel-perfect mockups.
- **Usability testing:** Usability testing entails evaluating a product or service by testing it with different users. Participants will try to complete tasks while the UX designer observes, takes notes, and sometimes asks questions. Testing the product with a prototype allows usability issues to be identified and fixed before the product is built.
- **Accessibility:** Accessibility is about designing for everyone. Evaluating accessibility will involve analyzing how well products, devices, services, or environments have been designed for people who experience disabilities. A good UX designer makes sure that their designs are usable by as many people as possible.
- **Visual design:** Visual design includes the aesthetics of a site and strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand.

# **Soft skills**

In addition to core technical and analytical skills, there are also some soft skills that UXers use regularly:

- **Communication:** Communication is vital in any UX/UI role. Designers are responsible for explaining and defending design decisions to their own team as well as to other departments.
- **Flexibility:** Flexibility is vital; you will encounter differing points of view, and feedback and revisions are part of the process. Don't get too attached to your first design, because there may be a better solution or a technical limitation that makes an idea difficult.
- **Empathy:** Empathy is an important skill for any UXer. You'll need to understand what a user's goals are and explore how to help them accomplish their goals.
- **Curiosity:** Curiosity is crucial because learning will be an ongoing process and it's helpful to keep an open mind. UX designers are constantly learning and adapting to new standards and information.

# **The UX designer at work**

What does a UX designer actually do? There's still a lot of confusion surrounding the field of UX, and you may need to address this anytime that you're starting a new job as a UX designer. In fact, your first task may be to clearly explain the value that you bring to the company and how you'll bring that about. Advocacy for your job will be at the core of your work as a UX designer. You'll need to highlight the important value you bring by incorporating the user and their needs into every project.

A user experience designer is often a generalist; they may have some or all of these skills listed above. Usually, a UX designer works on a team. And depending on the size and type of the company, the team may be large or small. At some small start-up companies, there is only one lead UX designer for the entire company. And if a company is *lean*, it means that they want to streamline and focus on delivery and rapid iteration, instead of allocating resources to in-depth research and multiple specialized team members. In cases like this, generalists, such as versatile UX designers, can be very valuable.

The titles below capture many of the current UX roles that exist across industries. However, over the years, the terms and positions have changed and evolved, and they will invariably continue to change and evolve. It's important to keep these shifts in mind as you carve out your own path as a UX designer.

# **User experience researcher**

A user experience researcher is someone who empathizes with the user and tries to understand their needs, behaviors, and motivations. A UX researcher is a multiteam player. They usually work alongside an array of other people, from business analysts to marketing teams, as they strive to align organizational goals and user needs. UX researchers often work on diverse teams that include UI and UX designers as well.

Key skills to know: User interviews, survey design, data analysis, usability testing

# **Information architect**

Information architects are the blueprint makers and information organizers of a product design team. They work to organize information and determine how it should be arranged and displayed, with ease of access and user flow as their guiding principles. Information architecture is a unique field that comes from information and library sciences. This job, which helps to define product strategy, is becoming more and more in demand.

Key skills to know: Card sorting, understanding of cognitive psychology, library sciences, user research analysis

# **Interaction designer**

Interaction designers focus on how a user interacts with a product and how they experience using it. This role focuses on designing the details of an interface, including movement, animation, user flows, and visual aesthetics.

Key skills to know: Visual design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, animation

# **User interface designer**

User interface (UI) design establishes the look, feel, and experience of a product. From layout and placement to the visual nitty-gritty such as buttons, colors, and fonts, UI designers occupy a unique niche under the user experience canopy. Many organizations combine UX and UI design into a single role.

Key skills to know: Visual design, user interface patterns, typography, layout best practices, color theory

# **Product designer**

Product designer is an ambiguous role that varies from workplace to workplace. It tends to include all aspects of product design, from user experience to interface design. Product designers and UX designers often hold the same responsibilities and need the same skill sets.

Key skills to know: Content strategy, sketching, prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping, storyboarding, scope definition, user interviews, survey design, data analysis, usability testing

# **Frontend designer**

Frontend web development brings together programming and layout in order to create a website's visual identity and interactions. A frontend designer programs the interface that UX and UI designers ideated, sketched, and prototyped. Frontend designers often work on diverse teams with UX and UI designers, and they are integral to realizing the UX/UI work. Although programming will not be the focus of this program, you will have the option to specialize in frontend design and start building skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—which will help you to land a frontend job or a UX job that requires frontend skills.

Key skills to know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScript frameworks

# **UX engineer**

The UX engineer is an emerging, multiskilled role that bridges UX design with frontend development. It is similar to the frontend designer, with a slightly different emphasis. Although most UX designers won't do any major development work, the UX engineer is likely a frontend developer, first and foremost, who has developed their UX skills. (In fact, sometimes the terms "frontend developer" and "UX engineer" are interchangeable.) They usually prototype in HTML and CSS, and they're able to easily communicate and transcribe UX work to development teams and vice versa.

Key skills to know: Strong frontend development expertise, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# **UX designer**

UX designers often perform some or all of the above roles, depending on the size of the company and team structure. It is a multifaceted job title that presents unique challenges. UX designers act as intermediaries; they advocate between different departments, teams, and stakeholders. They communicate complex concepts in terms that others can understand. A UX designer is responsible for knowing how a website or application functions, as well as how a user interacts with it. They must be able to communicate with end users, listen and respond with empathy, and quickly change strategy based on feedback. They are armed with some basic knowledge of information architecture, frontend code, and the capabilities of backend. And they must bridge the gap between functionality and visual design, while responding with agility to critique and remaining flexible and open minded to different solutions.

# **User experience design careers**

The most desirable product designers have a T-shaped set of skills and experience. In other words, they have an arsenal of skills and depth in one discipline but a breadth of experience across other disciplines. The successful **[T-shaped designer](http://www.karelvredenburg.com/home/2013/7/20/becoming-a-t-shaped-designer)** might be a super-skilled UX researcher who also knows enough frontend and UI that they can work alongside their diverse team of colleagues and help where needed.

In this program, you will develop a breadth of skills across UX/UI design. You'll also choose an area to develop additional depth. You can specialize in one of the following three areas:

- User research
- Visual design
- Frontend design

It's never too early to start thinking about how you might specialize and what roles you want to pursue. But it's important to acquire all the general skills. You want to make yourself marketable and keep yourself open to possibilities that might surprise you, so don't shortchange sections that don't call to you as much at first.

# **User experience design landscape**

UX design careers consistently rate among the highest for job satisfaction, and the day-to-day work is generally challenging, fulfilling, and well paid.

Based on **[research from The Creative Group](https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide/creative-and-marketing)**, the current salary data for UX-trained job searchers looks promising:

- UX designer
    - 1–3 years: $75,000–$96,250
    - 5+ years: $118,000–$148,000

# **Summary**

With the growing awareness of the importance of UX, companies of all sizes are seeking talent to improve their products and best practices. Demand for specialized professionals outweighs supply, as there are not enough designers to fill the roles. The average salary for a UX designer is higher than that of a graphic designer and other types of designers with similar experience. The field is growing, and there are no signs of demand slowing any time soon. UX is a rewarding career with high rates of satisfaction among professionals. The role is challenging and requires a willingness to make mistakes and learn from them. The first step is getting started—so well done!

In this checkpoint, you have gained a broad understanding of UX, including glossary terms and a breakdown of the components that comprise best practices. You've been introduced to the skills and standardized information that you'll use throughout your career, and you've explored the various roles available within the field. You've explored the differences between each role, including the differences between UI and UX.

You are aware of cross-functional roles and the T-shaped designer analogy. Regardless of whether you choose to focus on UI or UX, you will need to have a good understanding of both to practice either one. A good UI designer has a solid grasp of information architecture and the nomenclature for the underlying structures in the app that they are visually designing for. Similarly, a UX designer must have some sense of visual design and layout to be able to successfully convey concepts. You do not have to be an artist or even particularly good at drawing to be a UX designer. But you do need to be able to at least draw simple concepts that are easy for a team to understand. A UX designer will need to make the occasional on-the-fly quick whiteboard sketch to explain an idea to their team.

You have been armed with the latest and most accurate salary information, which is published yearly by industry specialists. You know what is possible, and you're aware that many exciting opportunities await creative professionals. A good UX designer constantly stays up to date with information, forecasts, and trends in their chosen field. This is a profession in which you should never rest on your laurels. Design leaders stay ahead of the information curve and constantly apply new knowledge to their craft. Make sure to bookmark and revisit the following list of resources regularly.

# **The design thinking process and empathy**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to define and explain the design process and advocate for the importance of empathy in design. You will demonstrate an initial ability to empathize with a user by producing two empathy maps.*

In this checkpoint, you will analyze the *design thinking process*, which refers to the cognitive, strategic, and practical processes that go into developing design concepts.

You will explore the process, focusing on the key element of empathy. As you walk through the design process, you will be introduced to many new terms and ideas. The purpose of this checkpoint is to give you an overview of a very complex process. Then, when you learn how to do things later, you will be better equipped to understand how it all relates to the bigger picture. For now, focus on trying to understand the overall flow.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete an assignment creating two empathy maps for different user personas, representing your first deliverable as a designer!

# **The design thinking process**

# **What is design thinking?**

In *design thinking*, a UX designer's goal is to understand the user, reframe their problems, and challenge assumptions. They also try to identify alternative design solutions based on the user and their needs. It's a way of thinking, ideating, and producing that includes hands-on methods.

Design thinking revolves around questioning, understanding, and researching the *people* the products or services are designed for. You can use this process to help with several key tasks:

- Observing and developing empathy with your target audience.
- Engaging in the process of questioning: questioning the problem, questioning the assumptions, and questioning the implications.
- Reframing design problems in a human-centric way, so that you ideate with an open mind and adopt a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.
- Experimenting in fun and experiential ways, such as sketching, prototyping, testing, and trying out concepts and ideas.

Check out the video below for a quick snapshot of design thinking:

The five steps for the design thinking process are as follows:

1. **Empathize:** Fully understand, relate to, and share another person's expressions, needs, and motivations.
2. **Define:** Analyze and synthesize your observations in order to identify the core problems that you've uncovered in a human-centered way.
3. **Ideate:** Generate ideas, including out-of-the-box and creative, unconventional solutions to the problem identified in earlier stages.
4. **Prototype:** Develop an inexpensive, scaled-down version of a product to be shared with users. The prototype should be interactive, and it simulates how the solution will work when it's built.
5. **Test:** Investigate and observe users interacting with the prototype, and adjust or iterate based on the user's experience and feedback.

# **Step 1: Empathize**

Empathize is perhaps the most crucial and most often overlooked stage in design. In this checkpoint, you'll focus mostly on this stage. Later in this program, you'll explore the other stages in more detail.

# **What exactly is empathy?**

> Empathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror, then share another person's expressions, needs, and motivations. In UX, empathy enables the designer to understand not only the users' immediate frustrations but also their hopes, fears, abilities, limitations, reasoning, and goals.
> 

Empathy is one of the many soft skills that a great UX designer should have. Empathizing with users is key to understanding how to solve their problems—and ultimately, to building better products based around usable solutions. Empathy allows a designer to step outside of their assumptions so that they can see and experience the products that they're designing from the perspective of their users. This creates well-informed and well-researched products that better serve the end users.

Empathy helps designers to understand and interpret people's emotional and physical needs. Empathic research is primarily concerned with facts about people, their motivations, inspirations, and thoughts. It's inherently subjective, but it still holds validity as another tool in a designer's arsenal of methods for creating usable products.

# **Empathy is not pity or sympathy**

Empathy requires people to deeply experience what others experience; the same is not necessarily true of sympathy. Sympathy is often associated with a sense of detachment and superiority; when people sympathize, they tend to feel pity and sorrow for another person.

Sympathy is not just useless in the design thinking process—it can actually be detrimental to good design. Good, user-centered designers are concerned with understanding the people they are designing solutions for, rather than judging them or projecting their own emotions onto their experience.

# **Users don't always tell you what they need**

As a user-centered designer, you need to develop intuition, imagination, emotional sensitivity, and creativity. With these skills, you can extract the right kinds of insights so as to make more meaningful and usable products. People do not always convey all the details or communicate what they need in a standardized way. You'll need to use empathy in order to really understand people.

# **Empathy is crucial to business success**

There are three key parameters that define a successful product or service: desirability, feasibility, and viability. Considering these parameters is an important part of empathizing with your users.

To be successful, a product or service must be technically feasible to create and maintain. It must turn a profit or offer other benefits so that it is viable from a business perspective. And users need to desire it; they must deeply relate with the solution that you are offering with your design, and be willing to trust the process.

For example, Google Glass was a failure on the company's part because users didn't like the experience and didn't feel good using the product. By contrast, the iPod was very successful at not only providing a technological solution but also providing a completely desirable and profitable experience for the user. As a result, Apple gained a market lead.

### Think about a time that you tried a product, and it either didn't meet your needs or was frustrating to use. Did you continue using the product? Or did you move on to a different solution? This is the scenario that UX designers want to avoid by making sure that they understand what users will actually use.

# **Examples of empathize deliverables**

You may be musing, "All this thinking is good, but what does a UX/UI designer actually do?" Whatever the task at hand, UX professionals need to produce tangible records of their work. These records can include a wide range of items: data, reports, presentations, sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and more. These items are usually referred to as *deliverables*. Deliverables are the *artifacts* or other outcomes that a designer produces from the work that they do. Artifacts—the concrete items produced by the designer—can take many forms.

Deliverables help UX designers communicate with various stakeholders and teams, document work, and generate materials for meetings and ideation sessions. They also help create a single source of truth; they can serve as guides and specifications for implementation and reference. Below are some examples of common types of deliverables that might be created during the empathize stage.

# **Persona**

A *persona* is a fictional user's profile, which is used to communicate and summarize user research. Each persona has defined goals and characteristics, which are representative of the needs of a larger group of users. Designers use personas to represent many users at once because designing with an individual composite "person" is easier than trying to design for thousands of different people.

# **Empathy map**

An *empathy map* is a graphical tool used to help you imagine things from a user's perspective. It usually asks you to answer some questions from a user's perspective as they encounter a task, such as the following: What do they see and hear? What do they think and feel? What do they say and do? By writing down these imaginings, you can more clearly conceptualize your persona interacting with a problem.

# **Quantitative survey**

A quantitative survey contains objective questions used to gain detailed insights from respondents about a survey research topic. Results from these surveys are used to gather numerical data and determine statistical results, and the data can share insights about user behavior. Quantitative surveys are also useful for justifying decisions to stakeholders.

# **Step 2: Define**

During the define stage, you connect the dots from the empathize stage. You analyze your observations and describe them so that you can define the core problems that you and your team have identified up to this point.

# **Examples of define deliverables**

# **Problem statement**

In this stage, you should seek to define the problem in a formal *problem statement*. The final problem statement is a simple but effective way to bring focus to the insights that you've uncovered with your empathy maps. Ultimately, when you're making decisions, you must always return to the question, "Does this solution solve the problem statement?" If the answer is no, you have gotten off course. Ask this question frequently—you don't want to produce a fully developed product and then discover that it didn't actually solve the problem!

### In every project that you complete in this program, you will be asked to explain how your solution addresses your problem statement.

# **Competitive analysis report**

A competitive analysis report outlines the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors compared to those of your own business. Typically, it contains a description of your business's target market and details about the features of your product compared to your competitor's products. It is beneficial to know what your competitors are offering, what needs you can fill, and what problems you can find solutions for.

However, it's important to note that other types of professionals, like digital marketers, also develop competitive analysis reports to better understand the competitive landscape. A UX designer, by contrast, would likely go further and deeper into the design flaws of a competitor's product. For instance, they may engage in a *heuristic analysis*, which is a technique used to evaluate the interface and design of a product against specific design standards and principles. (But don't worry—you'll learn more about heuristics later in this program.)

# **Step 3: Ideate**

*Ideation* is a fancy word for coming up with ideas. By this stage, you've built a solid foundation: you have a clear understanding of who your users are and what they need, what problem you are trying to solve, and what solutions exist out in the world already. Now you can finally start thinking about what you are going to make!

# **Some ways to ideate**

# **Brainstorming**

Most people are familiar with brainstorming. To get the most out of brainstorming, set a time limit. Try to focus on quantity over quality and write down as many ideas as you can think of. Do not worry about whether your ideas are practical, too expensive, or unrealistic. Just try to get down as many ideas as you can without judgment. The weirder or more outrageous, the better! This process can be done alone or in a group setting.

# **Mind mapping**

A *mind map* is a visual diagram that represents words, tasks, and ideas associated with a central keyword or idea. It doesn't have to be restricted to just words; you can also use drawings or colors. Begin with writing one word that summarizes the problem that you want to solve or the idea that you want to build on. Then, from that word, draw lines out and branch off into new words that relate to the core issue. You can also use other elements, such as color or imagery. Use lines to show connections between ideas and solutions. Create subbranches for ideas related to the main branch's ideas.

# **Examples of ideate deliverables**

# **Sketches**

Sketching is a crucial skill in UX design. Be wary of the impulse to skip it! If you can sketch simple shapes—like rectangles, squares, circles, lines, and stick figures—then you can quickly communicate concepts and revise them on the fly. If you can sketch quickly, you can share an idea and immediately influence the outcome of a meeting with stakeholders, instead of taking hours to make wireframes. Also, nothing is more frustrating than spending hours on wireframes and then having to scrap them completely and start over because there wasn't an initial consensus on direction.

# **User flow**

A *user flow* is the path that a user typically takes on a website or app to complete a task. The flow leads from the entry point, through a series of steps, and toward a final action such as purchasing a product. User flows are useful to help demonstrate to other team members how a user interacts with an application. In some ways, this may sound similar to the experience maps that were described above. The key difference is that a user flow addresses a user's interaction with a specific product and how they click through the site. An experience map is more general and isn't related to any specific product.

# **User stories**

A *user story* (also called a *use case*) is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website. Each one is a documentation of a sequence of steps, starting with a user's goal and ending when the goal is fulfilled. There can be multiple user stories for one application, depending on what a user is trying to accomplish and whether they're working toward a main or tertiary goal. These user stories should clearly demonstrate how your solution resolves your problem statement.

# **Storyboards**

In UX, a *storyboard* is a tool that visually lays out and explores a user's experience with a product—similar to the storyboards that are used in movies. Storyboards are valuable because they provide context about how and why people use products. They provide insight into the users' surroundings and goals, and they build relatable narratives.

# **Mood boards**

*Mood boards* communicate the artistic direction of a project. They are created through a collection of images, fonts, interactions, features, icons, and UI elements. It can be useful to look at different projects for inspiration about visual design and other features.

# **Step 4: Prototype**

In this stage, the design team produces some inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product. These prototypes are useful for investigating the design solutions generated in the previous stage.

This stage helps the design team get a better idea of the challenges and constraints that are present. It allows internal and external stakeholders to get a better idea of how real users will interact with the end product.

# **Examples of prototype deliverables**

# **Wireframes**

Think of a *wireframe* as a blueprint that provides the basic framework of a website. Some features are included, but they are not very detailed. Wireframes are valuable because they include enough features to conceptualize what the product will look like and how it will function—without spending too much time on visual details like color and typography.

# **Prototypes**

A *prototype* is a clickable series of connected mockups that simulates how the solution will work when it's built. Sometimes it is difficult to explain a concept to team members; a clickable prototype that functions like the real software can help with clarification.

# **Step 5: Test**

In this stage, designers or evaluators go through the process of real-time testing. Although this can seem like the last stage before a product is sent over to the developers, design thinking is actually an iterative process. The results generated during the testing phase are often used to define pain points in a product's design. Then the team might go back to the prototype stage and work through these issues before retesting the product.

# **Examples of test deliverables**

# **Usability report**

A *usability report* is a document that allows you to gain insight into user expectations and frustrations. It can be crucial in evaluating your product's success. It provides insight into user frustrations and behavior, which can provide feedback and improve the product.

# **Analytics report**

An *analytics report* is a custom report with dimensions and metrics that you decide. It's a good way to explore custom information and deeper targeted metrics about your product.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you explored the design thinking process, which consists of the cognitive, strategic, and practical processes that go into developing design concepts.

Throughout this checkpoint, you focused on the key element of empathy. Empathize is the first stage of the design thinking process, but designing with empathy is essential throughout all five steps of the process. Empathy is crucial to a human-centered design process because it helps design thinkers to set aside their own assumptions about the world in order to gain insight into their users and their needs.

As you learned, UX designers do a lot of different things on a daily basis. In this checkpoint, you also evaluated UX deliverables. Whatever the task at hand, UX professionals need to communicate design ideas and research findings to a range of audiences. They use deliverables for that purpose.

# **Understanding users: UX research in action**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to advocate for the value of user research. You will also be able to explain the history of human-centered design and describe how it applies to user research.*

In the previous checkpoint, you completed an empathy mapping project. You sought to understand users, as represented by two personas, and began thinking about solutions. In this checkpoint, you'll delve deeper into empathy and complete a design thinking challenge centered around social change.

You will also look at the value of user research for understanding the user, and you'll take a tour of what a user researcher does in their career. At the end, you will have an assignment to review two case studies and create your own problem statement.

# **Key terms**

- Human-centered design (HCD)
- User research
- Empathy
- Empathy mapping

# **Human-centered design**

*Human-centered design* (HCD), which is also called *user-centered design*, is an approach to problem-solving that is commonly used in design frameworks. To create solutions, HCD uses the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process.

How does HCD work in the real world? Typically, you and your team will observe a problem within a particular context, brainstorm and ideate, conceptualize, and develop a solution to implement.

There are three phases of human-centered design: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. You may be wondering, "Didn't I just learn a similar-sounding set of phases in design thinking?" There is indeed a lot of overlap; HCD and design thinking are often used together. Design thinking is a process that is used to go from problem to product, while HCD is a philosophy that can be applied along the way. Design thinking and HCD can work together to help you develop empathy in every part of the process.

These ideas may seem muddy at first, and that's okay. They are difficult to grasp because they are less about following rules and more about shifting the way that you think. The more that you engage with these ideas along the way, the more that you will start to develop your own design point of view and see how these ideas inform practical activities.

# **Overview**

Here's an overview of each stage:

1. **The inspiration stage** requires research. In this stage, designers engage directly with the target audience to understand their biggest problems and pain points.
2. **The ideation stage** is a brainstorming session. It requires designers and researchers to create a long list and tweak it, take good ideas and make them better, and then refine and revise as necessary.
3. **The implementation stage** is the time to market the product. Using empathy, designers imagine themselves in their users' shoes and market to them from that point of view. Designers must keep in mind how they would want to be marketed to if they were the end user.

An example of a human-centered product is the electric toothbrush. The streaming service Spotify provides another example; it addressed specific user pain points: music was too expensive, too hard to find in stores, and often required a cumbersome ordering process.

# **History of human-centered design**

Design theorist Horst Rittel devised the term *wicked problems* to describe complex problems that aren't easily solved. He asserted that problem-solving methods should be collaborative, adaptable, and centered on the complexities of human behavior. This concept served as the foundation for human-centered design.

So, what exactly is human-centered design? Human-centered design is a creative problem-solving process that begins with understanding human needs and ends with innovative solutions. HCD was championed by Nobel Prize laureate Herbert Simon, and it was developed and taught by the Stanford University Design School. It was then leveraged by design firm IDEO.

**[IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/post/design-kit)** is an innovative design firm. It was one of the first firms to focus on creating experiences beyond the screen, and human experience is at the forefront of every product and service that they offer. IDEO popularized human-centered design and applied it along with the design thinking approach.

You may have noticed that IDEO has been mentioned several times already in this program. This is because it has had a big impact on shaping the way that modern product design is done. Using HCD processes, IDEO innovated the first computer mouse, which was used by Apple for the Apple Lisa computer. Their first attempt at a mouse was far too expensive and difficult to make. Through feedback and constant revision, they were able to make a working prototype that was affordable and viable—and eventually went on to be mass marketed. The mouse brought about a huge change in the way people interacted with a computer. It made navigating an interface more accessible for the average person, because it made it unnecessary to learn and memorize a bunch of keyboard shortcuts.

IDEO is an international design and consulting firm with three decades of experience and multiple branches in the United States and Asia. As a thought leader in the design industry, the company makes many resources available for free use, including case studies and certifications. IDEO also produced a free book, the **[HCD Toolkit](https://www.ideo.com/post/design-kit)**, that outlines how human-centered design impacts not only designers, but also innovators, entrepreneurs, and educators.

HCD should inform how you approach any role in UX/UI. But it is especially important for UX researchers, who are often the closest to the users.

# **User research careers**

A career in UX research can seem daunting because it is a constantly evolving field with differing schools of thought and flexible parameters. Because UX research encompasses multiple disciplines, there is no simple and linear path to achieve it. Unlike many other tech roles, UX research is best learned from hands-on application and collaboration. Learning UX theory from books is an important step, but learning by doing is absolutely critical. Guidance from subject matter experts (SMEs) and mentors is also essential. Foundational research skills must be practiced often to encourage growth and maturation of the skill set.

For these reasons, after the *Fundamentals* modules of this program, everything that you do will be heavily project based. You will receive feedback from experienced designers through your mentor, graders, assessors, and technical help.

The role of a UX researcher is to discover insights, make connections, and guide the design process early on. Before any slick screens or glossy effects and interactions can be chosen, there needs to be a foundation in place to build upon. A UX researcher has a critical and unique role; they use a combination of data-supported metrics and thoughtful qualitative information to make meaningful correlations and suggestions. Their goal is to represent the users and provide the best possible experience for them. UX researchers also serve as liaisons between multiple departments and stakeholders.

Although tasks and responsibilities vary depending on the size of the team and business, UX researchers are generally responsible for the following:

# **Recruitment and planning**

- Crafting a well-developed plan with clear goals and objectives
- Developing usability tests, interviews, and surveys
- Recruiting participants for research studies and usability tests

# **Information gathering**

- Observing moderated usability tests
- Using surveys to gather quantitative data

- Recruiting participants for research studies and usability tests

# **Information analysis**

- Discovering insights about end users
- Analyzing the findings and translating them into meaningful, actionable ideas

# **Insight presentation**

- Using journey maps, personas, and other deliverables to present discoveries to other teams

# 

# **Action plan**

- Gathering information while working with the product team
- Determining research goals and executing the research plan

There are many different methods that can be used throughout the research process. One of the most crucial research tasks is to accurately summarize, capture, and represent users in a persona. A detailed persona will include goals, pain points, and frustrations that users encounter. These should be distributed to other teams and will guide the development of a product based on insights rather than assumptions. Personas, in combination with other assets and deliverables, provide valuable insights that can be used by stakeholders throughout the development process.

# **Making the case for user-centered design research**

Part of being a UX practitioner is advocacy. Since not everyone is a UX expert who immediately understands the value that research brings to the table, you will need to share your knowledge with the people around you. It is part of your job to ensure that other people realize the value of research, and to push back against the perception that it is abstract or unnecessary.

You may find yourself wanting to jump straight to solutions and start building the product. But just as a building needs surveys, blueprints, and a solid foundation before it's time to start picking out the wallpaper, it's absolutely critical to do the hard work of research before generating solutions.

To communicate the value of research, it can be helpful to put it into more tangible terms. Try to connect it to the results that stakeholders are looking for. For example, to show how your research will help the company cut costs or increase profits, you can use a metric called *return on investment*, or *ROI*. This is a way to justify the time and space needed to conduct research. Often, large enterprise companies find numbers more persuasive than anything else.

The good news is that poor user experience directly affects the bottom line, and you can use this knowledge to your advantage. When you are deciding how to communicate the value that your research can offer, keep in mind that phrasing is important. All of your work can be translated into business-friendly terms. For instance, "brainstorming" can sound a bit superfluous; try translating this into "strategizing and analysis phase" when you're describing the process to stakeholders. Keep action words in mind. The metrics are always there—you just need to learn where to search for them. Try to make connections between current inefficiencies and show where and how UX can improve the process.

One example is the time, money, and resources that programmers spend completing avoidable rework. If the organization spends a bit of time up front to conduct usability testing, this labor can be avoided. To get an accurate idea of the numbers, you can simply ask. Or you can observe how much time the development team spent redoing work because of needed changes that went unidentified the first time around. It's not uncommon for the engineering team to spend 50% of their time on such a task. How many hours could you save them by spending four hours on six different usability tests?

Another thing to consider is how long it can take to train someone to use overly complex or nonintuitive software. How can you help save time and labor on training by closing inefficiency gaps up front? As you conduct these tests, document the changes that you make and the time that you save. Keep track of how you document your work and your process, because it is key in communicating with your colleagues and putting it into terms that they can understand.

# **Quantity versus quality**

The data gathered from conducting research will fall into one of the following two categories: *quantitative data* is information about quantities or numbers, and *qualitative data* is descriptive and concerns phenomena that can be observed but not measured. Quantitative data is easier to gather quickly and in large quantities, but it doesn't allow for much nuance or deeper insight. Qualitative data, if done right, can provide much richer information—but it is more difficult and takes longer. During a project, there may be different times to use each approach. In later checkpoints, you will get into how to develop and carry out your research plan.

# **Market research versus UX research: Why not both?**

It is critical that you know the differences between market and UX research. Each is important and contributes to your overall goals in different ways. Generally, market research refers to understanding purchasing behavior and preferences around products and messaging. It is used to gather demographic information and understand the attitudes surrounding a product. The intention behind market research is to provide insight into the viability and market strategy for a product.

While the goal of market research is to sell products, the goal of UX research is to focus on the interaction between customers and products. It identifies the ways in which people use a product, and it explores the problems that they encounter during the process. It also uncovers the needs that aren't being met within the existing model. The information gathered informs design solutions. Then, iterative testing can help ensure that the prototype is aligned with users' needs. By implementing this research before a product is built, redundant work can be avoided, while customer service complaints and low satisfaction scores can be greatly reduced.

### User research is a deeply important skill set that you could build an entire program around. If you feel strongly that you want to pursue a researcher role, you will be able to choose to specialize in user research later on in the program. And if you don't, the rest of the program will give you a sufficient foundation for other roles.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you analyzed human-centered design, which is a fundamental principle in UX design. HCD should be learned early on and kept at the forefront of a practitioner's mind. Everything a designer works on, from an interface to a material product, should aim to be useful and improve the lives of other people. Even saving someone a click or a few seconds can make the difference between a purchase or an important decision that could influence their future. As a designer, you should always be thinking about how you can improve things.

You also looked at the value of user research for understanding the user, and you took a tour of what a user researcher does in their career.

In the following assignment, you'll delve deeper into empathy. You'll be asked to complete a design thinking challenge centered around social change.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you explored user interface design. You discovered what it is, how it differs from UX design, and what you will actually be doing as a professional UI designer if you pursue this career path. You developed an understanding of what UI is and began to discover best practices.

# **Designing for people: Usability and accessibility in UX/UI**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to discuss the different components of accessibility. You will be able to explain why they are important and how they contribute to better usability.*

In this checkpoint, you will become familiar with the different aspects of accessibility. You will explore why they are important and how they contribute to better usability. You will also gain a deeper understanding of how to design for usability by analyzing the seven universal design principles. At the end of the checkpoint, you will complete an assignment where you use common industry tools to evaluate the accessibility of some real websites.

# **What is accessibility?**

*Accessibility* refers to a user's ability to use a product or service. The extent to which users can attain goals is called *usability*.

Designers should keep all people in mind when creating a product, and they should create designs that accommodate the needs of as many prospective users as possible.

It is estimated that about 15% of all people worldwide—and 26% of Americans—have a disability. In the past, designers often considered designing for accessibility as a "nice to have" instead of as a necessity. But nowadays, designing for accessibility is recognized as a foremost consideration in the design process. Considerations for accessibility will automatically make usability better. Accessible design is good for everyone, as visualized in the comic below.

If a user has a frustrating experience when using a product, that doesn't mean that the product is inaccessible. But generally, if a user without a disability has a bad experience, an individual with a disability will likely have an even worse experience. For example, if a user with no visual impairments has to squint to read small text on a website, then chances are high that a person *with* a visual impairment wouldn't be able to read that text at all. If the designers and developers of the website were to increase the text size, then they'd be improving the experience and accessibility for all users.

Ease of use is paramount. And it's especially important to keep individuals with impairments or disabilities in mind while you're designing. This is the foundation for creating accessible designs.

# 

# **Government resources for universal design and accessibility**

In 1998, the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, requiring that federal agencies make their digital tools, media, and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. This revised policy is called the Section 508 Amendment. In 2017, Section 508 was expanded further. Nowadays, all federal agencies and all federal contractors are required to comply with the guidelines that were established by Section 508. They must make a reasonable accommodation to meet the needs of users with disabilities, unless it can be classified as an undue burden.

Section 508 applies to all information and communications technology (ICT) associated with federal agencies and contractors. **[The policy describes ICT](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule)** as any equipment or system that is used to create, convert, duplicate, or access information and data. The following are examples of ICT:

- Telephones, smartphones, and mobile devices
- Televisions, DVD players, and videotaped productions
- Internet and intranet websites
- PDF documents
- Content on DVDs and CDs
- Online trainings and resources
- Webinars and teleconferencing
- Technical support call centers
- Remote-access websites and tools
- Tablets, laptops, and desktop computers
- Software and operating systems
- User guides for software and tools
- Copiers, printers, and fax machines

Although technically only federal websites and contractors are required to be 508 compliant, more and more companies and websites are becoming 508 compliant as a standard. Any UX designer worth their salt knows that accessibility is important. Section 508 is an important set of guidelines to familiarize yourself with as a designer, as it covers a range of issues related to accessibility. For a more in-depth resource, you can visit the **[government website](https://www.section508.gov/)** and view the policy itself.

**[A.D.A compliance](https://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/services/ada-compliance)**, which refers to the Americans with Disabilities Act (A.D.A) standards for accessible design, is another key concept to get familiar with as a UX designer. ADA standards state that "all electronic and information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities. These enforceable standards apply to places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities."

The A.D.A applies to all information technology. This means that accessibility compliance is legally required for web content, computer hardware, software, and documentation. So designing for accessibility is particularly important for anyone designing products that span this spectrum of use.

# **The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**

The **[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)** (W.C.A.G) are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines. They were published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium, which is the main international standards organization for the internet.

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/975b2307-442f-4609-b713-706851d62430/uxui-fun-uxd-v1/assets2/m1_designing_for_people/WCAG_Screenshot.png](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/975b2307-442f-4609-b713-706851d62430/uxui-fun-uxd-v1/assets2/m1_designing_for_people/WCAG_Screenshot.png)

**[W3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)**

No two people experience disability in exactly the same way, and no two accessibility barriers are quite the same. But these barriers can be organized into functional accessibility groups, and this idea was used to create the WCAG guidelines. As described below, the guidelines are organized around four main principles, which are collectively known as the *POUR principles*.

- **Perceivable:** A user should be able to use their senses to identify content and interface elements. For many users, this means perceiving a system visually. For other users, it may be a matter of sound or touch. The content should be consumable in different ways. An example of this is including closed captions for a video.
- **Operable:** A user should be able to successfully use controls, buttons, navigation, and other necessary interactive elements. This includes identifying an interface control visually, and then clicking, tapping, or swiping. For other users, using a computer keyboard or voice commands may be the only means by which they can operate and control the interface. To evaluate how operable a design is, consider these questions: Is the site confusing? Does it operate without the use of a mouse or complex interactions?
- **Understandable:** Understandable technology has several defining qualities. It's consistent in presentation and format, and it's predictable in design and usage patterns. It's also concise, multimodal, and appropriate in voice and tone for the audience that it's intended to reach. A user should be able to understand the content and learn how to use the interface. To evaluate how understandable a design is, consider these questions: Is it easy to understand how the user interface of the site functions? Is it easy to digest the information on the site?
- **Robust:** Users should be able to choose the type of technology that they wish to use when they interact with websites, online documents, multimedia, and other information formats.

Each of these principles is measured using the following success rating: A (meets minimum requirements), AA (meets many criteria for accessibility), or AAA (meets all the criteria for accessibility).

POUR principles were developed for web accessibility, but they can be applied to almost any accessibility question. Technology providers must ensure that their users can all perceive, operate, and understand their technology. And the technology must be robust enough to work across a spectrum of technologies, including assistive technology.

# **Universal design: Design for everybody**

There are about a billion people who live with disabilities. Companies that do not make their technology accessible are missing out on a huge percentage of the market—not to mention their ethical and legal obligations. And anyone could become a member of that group at any time, especially as they age. Designers should keep in mind that the more accessible a product is, the more it contributes to overall usability—which is good for everyone.

There are several classifications of disabilities: physical impairments, neurological and degenerative disorders, disease, traumatic injury, vision, hearing—all can impede mobility, dexterity, and comprehension when accessing a website.

Helping all users by designing for accessibility and addressing barriers is also known as *universal design*. You can increase accessibility by applying the **[seven principles of universal design](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm)**, which were developed at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 1997 to help guide the design of products. According to the Center for Universal Design at NCSU, the principles "may be applied to evaluate existing designs, guide the design process and educate both designers and consumers about the characteristics of more usable products and environments."

# **The principles of universal design**

1. **Equitable use:** The design should be useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. It should provide equivalent means of access to all users; it should not segregate or stigmatize users, nor make anyone feel unintelligent. Security and privacy settings should be easily accessible by any user.

1. **Flexible use:** The design should accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. It should provide choice in methods of use and provide adaptability. For example, it should accommodate right- and left-handed users.

1. **Simple and intuitive use:** The design should simplify complex information. It should use proper information hierarchy, progressive disclosure, and effective prompting towards task completion. It should be easy to understand how to use the design, regardless of the user's experience, background knowledge, expertise, language skills, or current concentration level. The design should eliminate unnecessary complexity and be consistent with user expectations and intuition. Designs should accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills. They should also include the use of a strong hierarchy that organizes information according to its importance, and should provide effective prompting and feedback after task completion.

1. **Perceptible information:** The design should effectively communicate necessary information to the user, regardless of the user's sensory ability. It should use pictorial, verbal, and tactile modes to redundantly present important information. It should provide contrast between information and its surroundings, and should maximize legibility. Elements should be differentiated in ways that can be described. For example, the design should make it easy to give instructions or directions. The technology should be compatible with a variety of techniques and devices used by people with sensory limitations.

1. **Tolerance for error:** The design should minimize and prevent hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. Elements should be arranged to expose the most used and most accessible elements, while the most hazardous elements are shielded or isolated. As a fail-safe to prevent unintended actions, warnings should be provided for hazards and errors.

1. **Low physical effort:** Anyone should be able to use the design efficiently and comfortably, with minimal fatigue. The design should minimize repetitive actions and sustained effort.

1. **Size and space for approach and use:** Elements should be spaced out enough so that they are not accidentally selected. Clickable areas should be large enough so that someone with mobility issues can easily select them.

# **Accessibility and identity**

Disability and impairments are not the only lenses through which designers must view accessibility. Without careful consideration, designing products for the "typical user" often ends up meaning that the products are for straight, white, cis men who are college educated. Products should be accessible for people with different identities and backgrounds, including race, gender, sexuality, education, and economic status. This means making sure that user research involves a variety of people from different demographics, that personas represent multiple populations, and that testing of prototypes involves diverse users.

# **Function before fashion**

The best way to center accessibility in your designs is to incorporate it from the very beginning. From its inception, your design should be inclusive of those who are color blind or have poor vision, people with hearing impairments or cognitive limitations, older users, and younger users. Consider the flow of your website and think about how different users will experience it. For example, is the navigation readable for older users or for those with limited online exposure?

Wireframes provide a great way to explore the usability of a product's infrastructure. Make sure that there is a strong hierarchy from the beginning, and that there is an easy and intuitive flow for users to complete a task. And be sure to display the most important and most used features *above the fold*.

The *fold* typically refers to the dividing line between what is seen and what isn't seen on a web page. The part of a page that's above the fold is visible on the screen by default when it opens. Because it's so prominent, this is where important functions and messages should appear. Any content that isn't displayed until a user starts scrolling is considered *below the fold*. (For smaller standard machines, 1280 × 768 is the smallest common resolution for a desktop computer.)

**Note:** Conventional wisdom has it that most users do not scroll down a page to see other content. However, research suggests that user behaviors around the fold have changed, and **[many people are actually willing to scroll](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/)** if they're interested in the content. Of course, the most important information in a website or application should still take center stage, and it shouldn't be hidden in a place where the user can't see it.

# **Here are some other steps that you can take to improve the accessibility of your designs:**

- Make sure that text is not part of an image so that it's readable by screen readers. If it's necessary to use text as part of an image, provide alt text so that people with screen readers won't be lost.

- When designing forms, use descriptive labels for the fields. Screen readers generally do not read the hint or helper text, which is the text inside fields that suggests the content that should be entered.

- Make sure that your hint text has sufficient contrast. It's common to see barely detectable light grey hint text inside of a field. But that's hard to see even for someone without any vision impairments. When you design, consider users with glasses or vision problems, and raise the contrast so that the hint text is easily legible.

- Consider enabling users to choose alternate methods when implementing such features as drag-and-drop. Someone with mobility issues may be physically unable to complete such a task. So be sure to add the use of up and down arrows on the keyboard, for example, as an alternative. All controls and elements should be navigable by the space bar and tab key.

- If there is a video on your website, provide captions.

- Use simple copy, helper text, and instructions that are not too elaborate or confusing.

- If the contrast between text and the background is too low, it will be hard for some users to see. To accommodate users who are color blind or have vision problems, use the appropriate contrast ratio between the text and the background. **[W.C.A.G standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)** specify that the contrast ratio should be at least 4.5 for any fonts smaller than 24px. But if your font is larger than 24px (or 19px bold), then it's okay to use a contrast ratio as low as 3.0.

As shown in the example above, the **[KKW Beauty](https://kkwbeauty.com/)** website doesn't have much color contrast. The shades of brown work on a visual design level to illustrate Kim Kardashian's contouring makeup line, which the colors illustrate. But for someone with accessibility issues, this could be hard to read.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you became familiar with the different components of accessibility; you explored why they are important and how they contribute to better usability. You also have a deeper understanding of designing for usability overall, after analyzing the seven universal design principles and considering how you might apply them to your designs. You will continue exploring and practicing accessibility throughout the program.

# **Putting it all together: Design foundations**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to self-evaluate your understanding of design thinking, the design process, UX design and research, UI and visual design, accessibility, and usability.*

In this checkpoint, you will review what you have learned and evaluate your skills as you begin this program.

# **Design thinking**

By now, you know that design thinking is a standardized process. You know that it's an empathetic approach to solving complex problems, and it was originally conceptualized with five stages.

The design thinking process can be applied in a variety of ways, and each organization can tailor it to suit their needs. Typically, this process has 3-7 phases, stages, or modes. All variants of design thinking embody the same core principles, which were first described by Nobel Prize laureate Herbert Simon in *The Sciences of the Artificial* in 1969.

The five phases, stages, or modes do not have to be sequential or follow any specific order. They can occur simultaneously and repeat iteratively. On many modern design teams, these five phases happen in iterative cycles.

- **Empathize:** Fully understand, relate to, and share another person's expressions, needs and motivations.
- **Define:** Analyze and synthesize your observations in order to identify the core problems that you've uncovered in a human-centered way.
- **Ideate:** Generate ideas, including out-of-the-box and creative, unconventional solutions to the problem identified in earlier stages.
- **Prototype:** Create an inexpensive, scaled-down version of a product to be shared with users. The prototype simulates how the solution will work when it's built.
- **Test:** Investigate and observe users interacting with the prototype. One by one, features are either accepted, improved, or rejected based on the user's experience and feedback.

# **The design process**

# **The double-diamond design process**

> "Double Diamond is the name of a design process model developed by the British Design Council in 2005. Divided into four phases—Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver—it is probably the best known and the most popular design process visualization." —Maciej Lipiec, UX Collective
> 

The UX design process can be approached in different ways, but this program will focus on the double-diamond approach. This process is iterative, and you'll rarely get the satisfaction of completely finishing the process. But this is what makes the work so exciting! You'll discover new insights that will lead you to rethink your design decisions and rework your solutions to produce a better and more usable product.

# **The phases of the UX design process**

- **Discover:** Conducting user research and gathering data
- **Define:** Analyzing data, brainstorming, and sketching
- **Develop:** Prototyping and user testing
- **Deliver:** Implementing solutions and high-fidelity prototyping

Within each of these main phases of the UX design process, there are several individual steps that you'll take to improve the user's experience with a product, app, service, or website.

In the double-diamond design process, multiple ideas are generated and then refined and narrowed into a unified vision. The process involves two main ways of thinking through ideas:

- **Divergent thinking:** Think broadly, keep an open mind, and consider anything and everything.
- **Convergent thinking:** Think narrowly, bring back focus, and identify one or two key problems and solutions.

# **User experience design**

*User experience* (UX) can be defined as a person's overall experience of using a product or service, such as a website, computer program, or mobile app. User experience is particularly concerned with ease of use.

A *user experience designer* is a person who serves in a challenging and complex role. They act as a valuable liaison between different departments and team members. *User experience* is often used as a general term that refers to multiple disciplines.

# **Key components and core skills of UX**

- **Research and analysis:** Before ever designing a screen or interface, it's important to understand the problem being solved and figure out who the users are. Every project starts with gathering requirements.
- **Information architecture:** Information architecture encompasses structural design, organization, and labeling of websites, intranets, mobile applications, and social media software. Information architecture aims to organize content so that it is easy to find and use.
- **Content strategy:** Content strategy refers to satisfying business requirements through content creation and distribution. This includes the words on the page as well as the images and multimedia.
- **Wireframing:** A wireframe is a simple illustration of a page's interface. It focuses on the layout, content, function, and behavior. Wireframes should be quick to make and quick to revise, so they do not typically include any styling, color, or graphics.
- **Prototyping:** A prototype is a preliminary version or draft of a product that allows a user to click through and simulate how the software will work before money and time are invested in developing the actual product. A prototype can be either low fidelity with linked-together wireframes, or high fidelity with pixel-perfect mockups.
- **Usability testing:** Usability testing entails evaluating a product or service by testing it with different users. Participants will try to complete tasks while the UX designer observes, takes notes, and sometimes asks questions. Testing the product with a prototype allows usability issues to be identified and fixed before the product is built.
- **Accessibility:** Accessibility is about designing for everyone. Evaluating accessibility will involve analyzing how well products, devices, services, or environments have been designed for people who experience disabilities. A good UX designer makes sure that their designs are usable by as many people as possible.
- **Visual design:** Visual design includes the aesthetics of a site and strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand.

# **UX research**

A user experience researcher works to understand user needs, behaviors, and motivations through a variety of techniques that focus on empathizing with the user. In companies with large UX teams, researchers sometimes work separately from interaction designers or user interface designers. But it is increasingly common to find them helping to guide the product development within diverse, multifunctional teams, alongside business analysts, marketing folks, UX and UI designers, and sometimes frontend developers.

# **Market research versus UX research**

**[Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-change-your-career-from-marketing-to-ux-design)**

It is critical to know the differences between *market research* and *UX research*. Each is important and contributes to an organization's overall goals in different ways. Generally, market research refers to understanding purchasing behavior and preferences around products and messaging. It is used to gather demographic information and understand the attitudes surrounding a product. The intention behind market research is to provide insight into the viability and market strategy for a product.

If the goal of market research is to sell products, the goal of UX research is to focus on the interaction between customers and products. It identifies the ways in which people use a product, explores the problems that they encounter during the process, and uncovers the needs that aren't being met within the existing model. The information gathered informs design solutions, and iterative testing can help ensure that the prototype is aligned with users' needs. By implementing this research before a product is built, redundant work can be avoided, and customer service complaints and low satisfaction scores can be greatly reduced.

# **UI and visual design**

UI design involves the aesthetics of a site and the strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand. Good visual design strategically implements images, colors, fonts, and other elements to enhance design and interaction and to engage users.

# **Usability**

In simple terms, *usability* is the extent to which users can attain goals. It refers to the ease of access and use of a product or website.

# **Accessibility**

*Accessibility* refers to a user's ability to use a product or service. Design should accommodate the needs of as many prospective users as possible.

It is estimated that worldwide, about 15% of all people have a disability. Accessibility compliance is legally required; ADA compliance standards stipulate that all electronic and information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities. These enforceable standards apply to many different kinds of environments, including places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities.

The **[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)** are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium, which is the main international standards organization for the internet.

# **Multidisciplinary teams**

A small company may have only one designer, while larger companies with bigger budgets may have several design or product people on a team. A lean team will be more focused on execution, while a more robust team may have an information architect and a dedicated user researcher. A designer on an agile or Scrum team may work on a multidisciplinary team alongside engineers, product managers, and marketing or business professionals.

# **User-centered design and research**

# **Review**

As you learned in a previous checkpoint, the terms user-centered design (UCD), human-centered design (HCD), and UX processes can be used interchangeably. They describe the following process:

1. Observe what people really do. Watch them use apps, websites, and other interfaces. This can help you achieve the following tasks:
    1. Identify real problems, challenges, and opportunities—instead of relying only on what people self-report
    2. Think of a variety of solutions that could address articulated or unarticulated needs
2. Test the solutions as quickly as you can visualize the idea. Testing can show you how easy or difficult it is for people to use products as intended, and show you how to improve the experience.
3. Iterate repeatedly on the ideas and solutions. Make adjustments as you gather feedback and observe usage.
4. Learn from your observations.

These design processes are meant to prioritize user needs, goals, and challenges. These processes focus on using observations to improve user experiences with human-made objects.

# **Mental models**

Just like everyone has their own imagination, everyone also has their own mental model. In other words, everyone has a personal perception of the world around them. In UX, a mental model represents how different users perceive their experience in the context of how a product or service fits into their lives.

Mental models are based on belief systems rather than facts, so factors such as taboos, superstitions, habits, fears, joys, and traditions can affect how people perceive their surroundings. They can also strongly influence how people incorporate a product or service into their day-to-day routines.

Mental models give project teams a common understanding of the way a person perceives and interacts with their environment.

**[Charlie Munger](https://fs.blog/charlie-munger/)**, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., suggests that there are numerous mental models that can help us dismantle and solve difficult problems. He writes, "You can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in usable form."

This latticework of mental models is key to adjusting your view of a challenge, because not every dilemma can be solved with a formula. Adaptability is a learned skill. The more mental models that you understand and experiment with, the better prepared you'll be to create usable products that users find pleasurable.

The *inversion perspective* is one of many mental models that can be applied to the UX design process. To apply this mental model, consider the outcome that you'd like to avoid instead of thinking about your desired outcome. For example, say you want to design an e-commerce jewelry app. Instead of asking yourself, "What are the top five things I could do to make this app usable and successful?" ask yourself, "What are the top five things that would prevent my app from being usable and adaptable by my target audience?" In an inversion perspective mental model, you then focus on minimizing those top five usability problems.

# **The career landscape for user experience research**

# **Responsibilities**

Your main responsibility as a UX professional is to advocate for those who use the product or service. While you may find yourself playing more than one dedicated role, there are ways to specialize within UX. If you decide to specialize in a certain area in UX, you may become an interaction designer, information architect, researcher, visual designer, or developer. You could also have some combination of those specific titles or different versions of them.

If you specialize in UX research, you will be responsible for leading the activities that help you and your team better understand your users so that you can design to meet their needs. This involves a lot of observation and conversation with a variety of people. Depending on the size and maturity of the company, you may be on a team with other specialists. For example, you might be part of a research team.

The best researchers often have the least to say, because listening and observing are two of the top skills that a researcher must demonstrate most often. It is important that the researcher can maintain a neutral stance on the product or service. The researcher also needs to be personable enough that participants feel comfortable opening up and sharing their real thoughts.

Some key traits that describe a UX researcher are poker-faced, patient, unbiased, inquisitive, investigative, and curious.

# **User experience research versus market research**

Review: Venn diagram of differences and similarities between UX research and market research

As you may recall from the previous module, UX researchers and market researchers are ultimately concerned with the same things:

- How and why users behave the way they do
- How and why users are consuming the product or service

However, UX researchers and market researchers differ in a few key ways:

- The type of data they use
- The type of research activities they perform
- When insights taken from each study are used to make scope, design, or release decisions

For example, a UX researcher will rely on market research techniques like website analytics and insights to determine how successful an app is once it hits the market. Personas created based on a qualitative UX research study could help a market researcher to determine why adoption rates have fluctuated over time. Both UX and market researchers might use a competitive analysis to help them understand the competitive landscape and anticipate how their product might perform in the market.

You need both UX and market research to tell a full story about user behavior.

# **The business case for research**

Some of the most common questions that UX professionals are asked by stakeholders are, "Why should we spend time on research?" and "Why should we spend money on research?"

Given that budget and time constraints that exist with most companies, these are valid and relevant questions that need clear and simple answers. That's where you, the UX professional, come in.

# **Why should we spend money on research?**

This is usually a "pay now or pay later" situation. Any activity involving product design has some costs, but we advocate for embedding research in the overall product design process during the early stages. Changing a product that has already hit the market can cost a lot. It generally costs less to use research findings to guide the design and development of a product in its early stages.

# **Why should we spend time on research?**

Again, this is a "do it now, or do it later" situation. People's needs, goals, and challenges change constantly, so we use research to understand how to stay relevant, useful, and enjoyable in the eyes of the user.

Consistently incorporating the insights that you gather from user research will help ensure that you release designs that meet the following criteria:

- Accessible to users
- Relevant to users
- Easy to use

Ongoing research can also help build credibility with users when they realize that their ideas and feedback are heard and implemented. It can give the impression that a company truly cares about the people who use their product or service.

**[Patricia Gestoso](https://patriciagestoso.com/2019/06/10/disability-as-an-innovation-driver/)**

*Accessibility* is often mentioned in the context of creating experiences that people with disabilities can access just as well as people without disabilities. However, the concept of accessibility is even broader than that. Accessibility considers all potential users, as well as all potential use cases that may allow someone to use a product or prevent them from using it. We often refer to the broader concept of accessibility as "designing for all." For example, socioeconomic, geographical, and cultural factors can influence whether or not people have access to products and services.

It has become convenient and popular to design for *happy paths* or best-case scenarios. In these scenarios, a user never makes a mistake or encounters an error, and the system works perfectly—just as intended by the designer or developer. Designing for intended use by the majority of people who will use a product can save time, money, and effort up front. However, it can lead to an overall subpar experience if the designer fails to consider factors that can impact whether or not a person can even try to use a product. That approach lacks empathy for those who may require designs that accommodate different types of interaction.

# **Usability**

The term *usability* refers to how easy or difficult it is for users to complete intended tasks using a product or service.

How do we determine whether or not a system is usable? What determines how usable something is?

UXers can answer these questions partially on their own and partially by involving actual or potential users in their research. You will explore this in more detail in a later checkpoint.

# **Summary**

The user-centered design process helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and achieving goals that they consider important based on their mental models.

User research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. There are many different types and methods for research. Later in this program, you will learn more about how to determine how to create a research plan and how to carry out your plan.

# **Using research to understand users**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to articulate why it is important to always consider the experience of the people who will interact with or be impacted by the use of a product or service that you are designing. You will also be able to demonstrate familiarity with methods and tools that UX/UI designers use to better understand users' points of view.*

This checkpoint will enable you to do the following:

1. Define personas and articulate why they are important to use
2. Explain how users' decisions are impacted by their perceptions, biases, and persuasions
3. List the stages of behavior change and transformation

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete the following assignment:

1. Create a proto-persona who will go on a journey
2. Write the steps that your user will take to reach a short-term transportation goal

# **Who is the user?**

So far in this program, the word *user* has been used to identify the person who is interacting with a product or service. Some designers prefer to use the word *human* instead; many consider it a more relatable and accurate term. Don Norman, the influential godfather of user-centered design, has helped to popularize the term *user-centered design*.

Who is the user, exactly? Users can be any of the following types of people:

1. A consumer
2. A customer
3. An employee
4. Anyone who interacts with an interface as part of accomplishing some goal

# **Personas**

*Personas* are fictional characters that designers create to represent different types of users. Each persona serves as a way to model, summarize, and communicate research about a group of people in the real world. This helps the team focus on designing for a manageable and memorable cast of characters, rather than trying to keep track of thousands of individuals. Personas also help designers to create different designs for different kinds of people, and to design for specific user groups rather than a generic and vaguely defined populace.

Personas can serve as visual reminders that the team is designing for real people with real lives—not just for hypothetical user groups. Just like a real person, a persona has their own motivations, constraints, abilities, interests, and behaviors. A single persona can represent multiple age groups, genders, and other demographic characteristics.

You can use personas to assess your design development. Constructing personas will help you ask the right questions, and it will help you answer those questions with respect to the users who you are designing for. For example, each persona will have specific behavioral patterns, attitudes, motivations, and challenges when it comes to how they use technology, how they spend their time and money, and what is important to them.

Imagine that you're creating a product, and you've finished your initial user research. You've identified three main potential types of users. To represent these user types, you've developed and named three personas: Shania, Juan, and Lee. Here are some questions that you might ask:

- How would Shania, Juan, and Lee experience, react, and behave in relation to feature X or change Y within the given context?
- What do Shania, Juan, and Lee think, feel, do, and say when they encounter X or Y?
- What are their underlying needs that we are trying to fulfill?
- What would they find challenging when trying to accomplish their task with our product?

### Want a template to easily craft your personas or proto-personas? This **[simple Figma template](https://www.figma.com/resources/assets/user-persona-template/)** is a handy, integrated tool that you can quickly refer to while using Figma.

# **Personas versus archetypes**

Personas are often confused with *archetypes*. An archetype is the common representation of a group that shares the same basic motivations, usual goals, and typical behavior. An archetype represents a broad set of users with common characteristics. By contrast, a persona is a specific instance of an archetype; they may have traits from one or more archetypes, but they also have their own personal characteristics, interests, and habits.

For example, the hero archetype is characterized by courage, selflessness, and humility, while the villain archetype is characterized by intelligence, power, and immorality. Harry Potter and Batman are personas that represent instances of the hero archetype, and Joker and Voldemort are personas that represent instances of the villain archetype.

# **Traditional personas versus proto-personas**

Traditional personas are created based on extensive user research. Although the user research process can help to ensure that the personas are representative, it can make them expensive and time consuming to develop.

Some companies prefer to use an alternative type of persona called a *proto-persona*. Unlike traditional personas, proto-personas are developed based on the product team's intuition and anecdotal experience about how potential users might experience a product. This can help a design team to quickly construct personas and make sure that they're considering their users' perspectives—even without lots of research.

**Note:** Keep in mind that the terminology used in the design world varies. This program will distinguish between traditional personas and proto-personas, but you may find that some organizations use the word "persona" to describe both ideas. In your career, you'll encounter varying degrees of depth and research that go into these different personas.

Both traditional personas and proto-personas should be validated and updated as the design process continues. Personas serve as starting points to predict how users might interact with a product. However, as designers learn more about how their users actually behave, it's important that they edit their personas to keep them as accurate as possible.

# **Scenarios**

In UX, a scenario is a situation that includes at least one actor (person) and a sequence of events. UX designers use scenarios to give context to how a product or service is used.

A scenario can be task-based and *narrow*. This type of scenario focuses on specific circumstances, without much consideration for the circumstances preceding or proceeding it. For example, you might conduct a usability test on a company-furnished laptop in a lab. All of the usability test's prompts might focus on what the user is doing at that moment. This type of scenario incorporates relatively few of the potential variables. If the user were to use the system that you're testing in a more natural context, they might have other things going on in their environment. The user might also have other programs on their personal device.

A scenario can also be task-based and *broad*. In this type of scenario, a broader set of factors and loosely related tasks are included in the scenario, in addition to the tasks that relate only to the system being tested.

In general, scenarios paint a verbal picture of what is, was, or will be going on in a person's life in a given timeframe. They can help you consider how people interact with a product from a holistic view, rather than only when they have the product right in front of them.

# **Experience mapping**

Experience maps are discovery tools that UXers use to visualize the steps that a user might take before, during, and after they encounter a product.

# **Journey mapping**

**[Journey Mapping](https://uxknowledgebase.com/journey-mapping-part-1-6c9ad6d3bfbc)**

A journey map is a visualization of the twists and turns that users take as they encounter a product or experience. You can refresh and update your journey map as the product evolves. It's important to refer to the journey map as you are designing interactions. Consider the overall perspective of what the user is going through as they incorporate your product into their life. Think about the steps that users take in chronological order.

Keep this deduction process in mind and think through the steps that you take as you go about your daily activities. For example, consider all the steps that happen when you brush your teeth, check your email, or run errands around town.

# **Empathy mapping**

An empathy map is meant to further illustrate a persona's mental model. It considers how they perceive an experience with each of their senses, and it's used to communicate a persona. As more research is gathered about that persona, you can circle back to the empathy map and add new insights or remove any insights that have changed or been invalidated.

In an empathy map, you should focus mostly on areas related to the senses that we experience as humans:

- Thinking and feeling
- Seeing
- Hearing
- Saying
- Doing
- Experiencing negative emotions
- Experiencing positive emotions

# **Touchpoints**

When you think of touchpoints, you should imagine each time that a user could come into contact with a representation of a product or the product itself. It is important to think of touchpoints from a multi-channel perspective, because users will encounter the product or a representation of it on more occasions than you might expect. An example of this is when a user sees an ad for a car. A simple glance at a billboard or an internet ad can trigger a slew of thoughts; within seconds, a series of choices and decision points are already presenting themselves.

Before a user interacts with a company's website or sales representatives, they have already started making decisions:

> I want a new car versus I do not want a new car
> 

> I'm interested in the content of this ad versus I'm not interested in the content of this ad
> 

Each touchpoint is a catalyst for decision-making. Potential users are constantly making decisions: do the thing, don't do the thing, buy the thing, don't buy the thing, and so on.

# **Choices and decision-making**

Humans make choices in response to the following stimuli:

- Circumstance
- Necessity
- Emotion
- Environment
- Social influences

Whenever someone interacts with a product, they are choosing to interact with it. They might make that choice because they can't survive without it, or simply because they desire it. Determining whether a choice is driven by necessity or if it's a luxury is subjective and based on the perspective of the audiences in question.

As a designer, it is your responsibility to lessen the cognitive load that comes with choices and decision-making. You can do this by dissecting the choices that people have to make about using the products you create. You can also develop solutions that will make the need to decide seem invisible, or you can make the choices as clear and easy to discern as possible.

# **Influence, bias, and persuasion**

# **Bias**

Beware of biases, which can taint the research that you collect. Biases can make your results less accurate and useful.

If you aren't careful with your research design, your research could be vulnerable to biases, and your participants could unintentionally give you misleading data. Here are some common biases to watch out for:

- **Friendliness bias or acquiescence bias:** Telling you what they think you want to hear
- **Framing effect:** Responding differently depending on how your question was framed
- **Confirmation bias:** Interpreting information in a way that supports their existing beliefs
- **Hindsight bias:** Perceiving past events as more predictable than they were
- **Social desirability bias:** Saying things that make them look good
- **Sunk cost fallacy:** Continuing to do something that isn't working, because they've already invested effort
- **Serial position effect:** Remembering the first and last few items from a list better than the middle items
- **Illusion of transparency:** Overestimating how much they know about what someone else is thinking
- **Clustering bias:** Identifying patterns, even where no pattern exists
- **Implicit bias:** Holding implicit associations about certain groups and their behaviors
- **Fundamental attribution error:** Attributing errors to someone's internal characteristics rather than their circumstances

# 

# **Influence**

Both voluntary and involuntary tasks and behaviors, from painting a watercolor to hitting the return key to send a message, are influenced by a combination of factors. Here are some key factors that influence how people approach and complete tasks.

- **Ability**: A person will only complete tasks that they are able to complete. This idea is important in its simplicity. For someone to accomplish a task, the task must be possible to complete, and it must be possible for the specific person to complete it.
- **Perception**: Perception is a key driver of behavior. Perception is made up of several dimensions, including gender identity, cultural identity, and self-efficacy, which is a person's belief that they have what it takes (the skills and knowledge, for instance) to accomplish a task.
- **Attitude**: If someone has a positive mindset about accomplishing a task, then they are more likely to succeed than they would be if they had a negative mindset.
- **Attribution**: People often draw conclusions or make inferences about what has caused a behavior or event, such as considering the circumstances, personality traits, and other contextual information they observe. Determining the cause of a behavior and making certain attributions help people understand their experiences and interactions.

# **Persuasion**

Design can—and usually does—influence user behavior. Copy, which is text made into words, phrases, and sentences, can be perceived as a directive by the user—regardless of its intent. Persuasion is used in sales, marketing, health and wellness campaigns, and children's products. It's used to convince people to adopt, continue, or stop certain behaviors. For example, design may influence behavior related to brushing teeth, voting for a particular candidate in an election, or buying a new car.

Imagery, carefully chosen color palettes, language, and tone of voice all can help persuade someone to take a specific action.

# **Behavior change**

**[The Six Stages of Behavior Change](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stages-of-change-2794868)**

Each time we change our behaviors, we typically progress through six stages:

1. **Pre-contemplation:** Before deciding to make a change
2. **Contemplation:** Thinking about all the factors involved in the change
3. **Preparation:** Gathering information and resources and learning what it takes to make the change
4. **Action:** Doing something related to the change that you want to make
5. **Maintenance:** Continuing or repeating the new behavior on a regular basis
6. **Relapse:** Going back to behaviors from before the change

These stages describe a typical pattern, but they can vary; not everyone relapses into old behavioral patterns, and not everyone even considers changing their behavior in the first place.

# **Summary**

User research uses methodical and investigative approaches to understand user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations.

During this checkpoint, you became familiar with methods and tools that UX/UI designers use to better understand the users' points of view. You also learned why it's important to always consider the experience of the people who will interact with or be impacted by the use of a product or service that you are designing. Remember to consider everybody: direct consumers, indirect consumers, businesses, owners, stakeholders, and non-users.

# **Research methods**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify common user experience research methods. You will also become familiar with the methods and tools that we use to better understand the users' points of view.*

In this checkpoint, you will learn about ways to categorize research and evaluate which methods to apply, based on the needs of the user, the client, the organization, and the stakeholders.

User research is an iterative and cyclical process. First, a researcher observes and identifies a problem; next, they propose solutions to the problem. From these proposals, design solutions are prototyped and then tested with the target user group. This process is repeated as many times as necessary.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete the following assignment:

1. Match a list of five problem statements with the appropriate types of research.
2. Explain how certain methods within the types of research that you chose will give insights that could help solve your users' problems.

In this assignment, you will dissect a challenge so you can figure out how to get to know the populations who use a product or service. To create solutions that help people address their challenges and accomplish their goals, you will need to understand and consider your user population thoroughly. Knowing what kind of research to conduct, even before you select a specific research method, will help you accomplish this.

# **Types of research**

# **Generative versus evaluative**

*Generative research* aims to generate ideas. This type of research is performed during the ideation phase. It helps define a problem and can identify previously unidentified challenges.

By contrast, *evaluative research* evaluates performance after the release of a product or service. It shows real usage measurements and can set the stage for metrics, measurements, key performance indicators (KPIs), and goal-setting conversations.

# **Qualitative versus quantitative**

*Qualitative research* deals with how and why people do what they do. This involves observation and direct contact with people taking actions. Your research method—whether you observe just for the sake of observing, or you talk to people and observe them using or potentially using a specific product—will depend on your specific goals. Are you seeking to identify new opportunities and challenges so that you can create new solutions? Or do you want to learn about how people incorporate a product into their lives?

*Quantitative research* answers the following questions: Who is doing what? How often? How long? Where? What device do they use to do it? Quantitative research focuses on quantifiable factors that describe a user's experience. This includes factors that can be counted, added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided.

Numbers are often considered to be the most trustworthy of written characters. As the saying goes, numbers don't lie. As a result, quantitative research, which can assess thousands of people at a time, is often favored over qualitative research, which can be more subjective and covers smaller audiences.

# **Behavioral versus attitudinal**

*Behavioral research* is based on observation of people performing tasks in the context in which they would normally perform them. This type of research "tells the truth" because self-reports tend to be less accurate than actual observations of behavior. For example, someone may tell you that they never eat dessert, but you might learn something different if you observe them. You may see them accept and eat a cookie that is offered to them—thus nullifying their assertion. Perhaps the person feels like they never eat dessert, or they seldom order dessert, or they simply forgot about the cookie they enjoyed months prior. Likewise, you might get different results if you ask someone to tell you how many times they exercise each week, versus if you watch and document the length and intensity of each workout over the course of multiple weeks.

*Attitudinal research* shows you how people feel about their experiences with a product. In this type of research, "truth" is based mainly on self-reporting—how people tell you that they feel, or the expressions that they outwardly display. It is not uncommon to encounter teams who believe that attitudinal research is too anecdotal to base decisions on, so it is important to back up your qualitative study with a quantitative study. An example of this could be seen in a quantitative study that uses a multivariate (A/B) test to determine whether people tend to favor the aesthetic of one version of an interface over another.

# 

# **Choosing research methods**

You should carefully choose the most appropriate research method for answering your questions.

To choose a research method, first you will need to determine the maturity of the product and identify which phase it is in. Then you can decide between conducting a generative study to collect and prioritize ideas or conducting an evaluative study to understand how an existing product is performing on the market.

Next, you can decide whether you need a quantitative method, like a poll that gathers data on household demographics, or a qualitative method, like a field study that observes how users interact with a product outside of a testing environment. You could also use a combination of the two to gauge users' attitudes about their experiences.

While you can make informed decisions about which research methods you think will work well, you should also give yourself permission to learn from your research findings. If you discover a method is not working as intended, pivot as quickly as possible.

**[A Landscape of User Research Methods](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)**

This image from the Nielsen Norman Group shows where each method falls on the behavioral-attitudinal spectrum and the qualitative-quantitative spectrum. The methods are arranged in quadrants based on their position on each spectrum. For example, number-heavy methods that show what actions people take on a screen fall in the quantitative-behavioral quadrant.

The image above was created more than 10 years ago. The facts about whether an A/B test is behavioral and quantitative, or whether an ethnographic field study is qualitative, have not changed—but the ways that you can use technology to perform these methods have changed. This impacts the nature of the data that you can gather.

These days you can use tools to conduct unmoderated usability studies that will give you more qualitative data. For example, you can allow test participants to type or say their opinions along the way, and you can use video to view their facial expressions as they complete the activities.

The number of research methods for studying user attitudes and behavior continues to grow as we create new ways of observing what people do and how they do it.

To avoid the trap of option overload, start by identifying the overall goals of the research. UXers often start by asking the stakeholders the following questions:

- What stage is the product in? New ideas? New version? Enhancements to an existing product?
- What do we already know about how people feel about their experiences with the product?
- Has a clear problem, challenge, or opportunity been identified?
- What motivates users to use the product? What motivates users to keep using the product? What unmotivates them?

To get a better idea of what methods might return the most relevant results, you can practice plotting your questions along the evaluative-generative spectrum, the behavioral-attitudinal spectrum, and the qualitative-quantitative spectrum.

# **Summary**

User research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. In this checkpoint, you read about some of the most common, repeatable, and recognizable research methods. But keep in mind that part of the research process is experimentation—you may even need to try different methodologies to find one that will meet your needs.

# **Insight translation**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to find and create foundational documents that will help you organize your research results. You will also be able to prioritize and communicate the most important decision-influencing insights that you gleaned from this research.*

At the end of this checkpoint, you’ll complete one assignment:

1. Explore case studies or research reports/syntheses that explain the purpose, process, and outcomes of projects that involved user research.
2. Create a template to help you share your research insights.

In this assignment, you will practice dissecting your research findings so that you share the most accurate and relevant information that will influence the direction of your designs.

Effective communication often involves a compelling presentation style, engaging visuals, and credible information. This lesson will help you practice telling the story of why you did research, what kind of research you did, with whom, and what you achieved.

# **User research types**

# **Findings and insights**

Findings or results are what you have observed and documented through your research. Insights are what your results actually mean. In other words, insights answer the question, "What did we learn?"

Below are some examples of research results:

- Twelve percent of survey respondents pay for highway tolls only once or twice a month.
- The majority of interviewees in this study are not allergic to peanuts.
- Out of 2,400 participants, 1,350 preferred screen layout option A over screen layout option B.

Without the context of what the study was trying to help the team discover, what do these hard facts mean? Nothing. They are left to the interpretation of the reader, which could drive design decisions awry.

This is why *insight translation* is important. To translate insights, you assess the information that you've gained from what you've observed, learn from the research methods that you chose, and explain what they mean to the people who will use your insights to make decisions.

Is it beneficial or detrimental that 12% of respondents pay for highway tolls only once or twice a month? Your insight translation will answer that question because you will be able to frame it in the context of the project's goals. If a goal was to gauge whether an existing app designed to encourage toll usage is effective within that population, that neutral statistic could be seen as negative, or as an indicator of ineffectiveness. If a goal was to learn about a certain population’s driving behavior, that neutral statistic could teach you that your assumptions about a target market are not as accurate as you thought. This could influence a decision to focus on a different demographic.

# **Know your audience**

Avoid forcing your audience to speak another language just because it makes sense to you—learn the language of the business, users, design teams, and development teams. Find a way to communicate ideas in a way that all of them can understand. Remember, the people who you are communicating with may not have spent as much time learning UX/UI terms as you have. If you use a gentle and inclusive approach, you can make sure that you all eventually reach a common understanding.

This process may require multiple translations. Just as if you had one Mandarin-speaking client and one Spanish-speaking client, a presentation in a single language may leave someone feeling left out. They may feel as though their needs are not being considered. As a UXer, it is your responsibility to consider the needs of all users. In this case, the users are the people who will be using your insights to make decisions.

# **Prioritize**

You will get a lot of information during a user feedback session like a test or an interview. If you organize a user feedback session, you will be responsible for the following tasks:

1. **Capture:** Make sure that you capture as much as possible. You can use written or typed notes, audio or video recordings, and scribbles, notes, or examples provided by participants. Be sure to record any observations of behaviors and anything the participant mentions, because you never know what could influence behavior.
2. **Evaluate:** Determine what pieces of information are most relevant to the project at hand.
3. **Rank:** Create a ranking system and work with your team to assign value to the data that you've collected. Information that directly addresses a research question or directly influences the production of the overall concept should be ranked as the highest priority. Information that will not impact the project in a major way or that represents ideas far outside of the project scope is the lowest priority.

# **Example**

Imagine that you conducted a usability test for a transportation app. During the test, you noticed that three of the five participants struggled to find the button to finish a transportation reservation. These three participants also mentioned that they did not care for the app's blue background.

The feedback about the color preference would be considered low priority, unless the ability to determine and express an opinion about the background color was one of your test tasks. By contrast, the observation that users struggled to find the reservation submission button would be considered high priority because it relates directly to what you were testing.

# **Collaborate**

**[Teams Graphic](https://live.staticflickr.com/8167/7449270292_a58bf8d6b4_b.jpg)**

During your career, you may have the luxury of working with a multidisciplinary team with team members who can create beautiful visual assets that tell the story of the product.

This is why people say that you can be great at UX even if you aren't a great visual designer. However, don't champion mediocrity either—do your best to ensure that any finished product, be it a set of mockups or an insight presentation, is visually appealing and easy to follow. This does not mean that it has to be the most beautiful, but it should be inviting, legible, and well organized.

# **If you *are* the UX team (team of one)**

**[Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)**

Templates are your friends. Find out if the client already has a presentation template that they like to use, or ask for their brand style guide so that you can stay consistent with their image. If guidelines don't exist or if you want to distinguish your work from what the client produces, then choose formatting styles that either align with your brand or are neutral. This will help you to avoid creating unconscious bias through your visuals.

In the interest of managing your time and effort, remember to prioritize your overall work efforts. Your goal is to communicate a message that will influence design and business decisions. Creating a presentation and gathering insights are tools and processes that will help you achieve that goal. In other words, the format of the presentation document is important, but your highest priority should be to make sure everyone understands what you did and why you did it. Unless it's part of your agreed-upon scope of work, limit the time that you spend choosing fonts, colors, and creating a layout. Focus on making sure that the information is clear, comprehensive, prioritized, accessible, and tailored to its audience.

If you can delegate or share the responsibility with a dedicated visual designer, that's great—now the onus of choosing the best visual presentation style is on the visual designer. That means you can focus more on content, overall flow, and delivery.

Even if you are not selecting fonts, colors, or margin size, it is still up to you to make sure that the presentation accomplishes the goal: to share what you did, why you did it, what actually happened, and what actions can or should be taken next. This might mean that you need to modify or suggest modifications to a presentation that a visual designer produces.

If someone else creates the assets, you automatically have less control over how they are produced. Imagine you hire a designer to make your presentation pretty, and they make beautiful work in Keynote⁠. But your client has a major vendor relationship with Microsoft, and no one on the team has the software to open your presentation on their Surface Pro. Not the best experience, right?

Make sure that you've properly converted all final materials to non-editable formats, such as a PDF file, a web page dedicated to case studies, or any other creative format that aligns with your agreement for how to share finalized documents. If it's part of your agreement, make sure that you also provide the materials in editable formats.

# **Create assets**

The assets that you create should be accessible—anyone who wants to view or read them should be able to do so. They should be able to access them as they are or easily translate them so that they can understand.

This may seem to limit how you can create a presentation, but remember that UXers need to cater their delivery to the users. This means that you will need to prioritize accessibility for users like the message receiver, idea generator and processor, repeat customer, and client team.

The number of assets that you create depends on the nature and needs of the project. There is no set rule about how many or what kind of files you need to create. Should you create your presentation in Google Slides? Keynote? PowerPoint? Should you make all of your interactive prototypes in Adobe XD, Marvel, or Sketch? To answer questions like those, you'll need to learn your audience and figure out what is important to them.

When in doubt, use empathy to assess the situation from your audience's point of view. Keep it accurate, interesting, and accessible.

The following table gives an overview of some assets that you might create:

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/82c55f1248fa485b8b1854d9ed9bb0d1)

# **Share early and often**

# **Here's a real-world scenario**

Wow! You learned so much during your most recent user study. You observed people using the product in ways that are very different from what your team anticipated. Your notes are immaculate.

However, you still have a few problems. None of your project team was able to join your sessions with users. You are working in tandem—you research while they work on assets, back-end setup, etc. Your team is working away at developing high-fidelity prototypes, but they're not testing well with real live users. For example, people are totally ignoring that huge call-to-action button that you all thought would be obvious.

How can you avoid a situation like this? By sharing findings early, often, and in context.

This means making your immediate findings known so that obvious issues can be avoided and designed for early on. Save your developers' time and stakeholders' money by communicating user frictions and challenges early in the process.

Make sure that your test subjects can find the *magic link*. In other words, check if they notice any major calls to action, things that the team intended for users to notice or find quickly, or elements that are essential for users to process through the rest of the flow. If most of your early participants struggle to find the magic link, let your designer know immediately. If you keep testing with more people, you will probably just keep seeing the same link placement issue that you already know about. Instead, if your designer immediately moves the magic link to a more prominent place, you can make new useful observations.

Additionally, consider that you've only observed a small number of users, and you can't be sure if their opinions are representative. You should not necessarily change course entirely based on the opinions of a small participant sample. And notably, different study types will require different sample sizes to reveal valuable, reliable insights. But desirability studies, which are often used to see if people like something, require much larger sample populations to be informative and help you make sound decisions.

Imagine if Frito Lay only tested new chip flavors on the first 15 people that they came across within 100 feet of their headquarters. They would only get the perspective of a small mix of people, and results could vary greatly depending on the preferences of just 15 people. If 10 out of those 15 people couldn't handle spicy food, Frito Lay might never learn how successful or unsuccessful a jalapeno-flavored chip might be. However, that 15-person sample size could help them determine whether people could easily find their favorite chip flavor on a website where they can buy chips in bulk.

# **Summary**

Collaborate with your team to share decision-influencing findings early and often throughout the research process.

Create engaging, accessible, timeless assets that clearly communicate to anyone who can read it. Based on your translations, readers should understand who, why, how, when, what, and what should happen next.

Determine what insights are most important to highlight for your stakeholder audience.

# **Ongoing evaluation**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to recognize and list multiple methods that can be used to evaluate the performance of your design.*

This checkpoint will introduce you to analytics and measurement tools as well as key performance indicators. You will also learn how to incorporate goal-setting early in the user-centered design process to set yourself up for a successful measurement process. To create solutions that will help people address their challenges and accomplish their goals, it's essential to thoroughly understand and consider your user population.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete an assignment. In this assignment, you will experiment with analytics tools and get practice articulating clear and measurable goals.

# **Measurable outcomes**

# **Analytics**

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/2238ee0b-501a-40f1-8314-fd9198dfc4a0/uxui-fun-design-and-research-v1/assets2/m2_ongoing_evaluation/Purchase_Funnel.png](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/2238ee0b-501a-40f1-8314-fd9198dfc4a0/uxui-fun-design-and-research-v1/assets2/m2_ongoing_evaluation/Purchase_Funnel.png)

A *purchase funnel* is a key marketing tool for conceptualizing the stages of a customer interaction. A basic purchase funnel includes the following steps:

1. The top of the funnel starts with acquisition and awareness—start by getting your user interested and engaged with your product.
2. Next, evaluate their behavior as they make the choice to purchase your product.
3. Finally, you are ready to convert your user into a customer who will start using your product.

With digital products, you can evaluate the entire purchase funnel process as you track your user's behavior, all the way from awareness to conversion. You can collect information that answers questions like the following: How did your user discover your product? What led them to engage with and ultimately purchase it?

For example, consider the official Yankees Merchandise Store. Imagine that their sales team sets a goal of increasing sales of their new ball caps. The store can gather user data with analytics and tracking, and then use the data to tailor their marketing and increase their sales.

One useful tool for digital analytics is Google Analytics. It's a powerful tool that can collect behavioral data from mobile applications, online point-of-sale systems, customer relationship management systems, and a plethora of other virtual platforms. Google Analytics also has built-in functionality to view and analyze data. It compiles reports, which you can use to perform an in-depth analysis of your customers and their journeys of engagement with your product.

Now it is time to set some goals and test new solutions!

# **Goal-setting**

Imagine that you've built a shiny new app, and you're confident that it will be downloaded a million times within the first week. Maybe someone told you that if you build it, they will come.

Rather than attempting to achieve the unknown by setting vague goals (such as "as many sales as we can get," "probably a couple months," "however long it takes," or "as many as we need"), many successful individuals and teams practice SMART goal-setting. You'll know that you have a good goal when it is set in a SMART way:

1. **Specific:** You will have multiple goals, so it's fine to break them down into smaller chunks. Being specific will help you define what success looks like to you. It will also help you identify exactly where things are working or not working in your strategy and in the product itself.
2. **Measurable:** Vague, subjective terms like "a lot" or "as many as possible" are not only obvious but immeasurable. What does "a lot" mean to you? To a small company, 100 new subscribers in a month might be a big deal, but a number like that could mean disaster to a larger firm. Be sure to include exact counts, percentages, or ranges when you talk about how many, how much, how often in your goals.
3. **Achievable:** Make sure to consider whether what you plan to do is even possible. Imagination is great, but, for example, setting a goal to have all the waters of the ocean free from plastic by the end of the year would probably be considered extremely ambitious and just about impossible.
4. **Realistic:** Do you have the time, resources, and commitment to realize your goal? In real life, can your product achieve what you think or feel that it can? If so, be practical in your approach to achieving it. Creating realistic goals can also extend into the planning process. For example, perhaps you strongly believe that your app can get 1 million downloads in the first week of release. A realistic plan—like a strong marketing strategy, or a strategy involving presales or exclusivity—could help you achieve that.
5. **Time-bound:** Time-bound—which you may also see called "timely" or "time-based"—means that the goal is associated with an unambiguous deadline. If the goal doesn't have a time limit, it can become unclear whether you didn't meet the goal or if you just haven't met it yet. It's essential to define a timeframe that specifies when you should check if a goal was achieved.

### SMART goals are used everywhere, including as an important tool in learning. While you're working through this program and building your skills, set SMART goals for yourself. This will help you to direct and measure your progress.

# **Key performance indicators (KPIs)**

Key performance indicators, or KPIs, are figures which translate the success of a project—however you define success—into measurable figures. You can choose to use common KPIs or you can define your own to fit the needs of the situation.

# **Behavioral UX KPIs**

Behavioral KPIs, which focus on what people do, include the following:

- **Time on task:** Time that users need to complete a task, as measured during usability testing
- **Error rate:** Number of user errors divided by total number of attempts
- **Task success rate:** Number of successfully completed tasks divided by the total number of attempts
- **Navigation versus search:** Number of tasks completed using search or navigation divided by the total number of tasks completed
- **Customer satisfaction scale:** Customer satisfaction, which can be gauged using various scales—such as numbers from 1-10 or smiley faces versus sad faces

# **Attitudinal UX KPIs**

Attitudinal KPIs, which focus on how people feel and what they say, include the following:

- System usability scale (SUS)
- Net promoter score (NPS)
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT)

# **Benchmarking**

*Benchmarking* is the practice of identifying and comparing performance to best practices, and evaluating the way that other companies in similar arenas perform over a period of time. You can see examples of different ways that people benchmark performance in most areas of life.

Sports benchmarks, for example, are based on game and player statistics—who has the highest score, or the most touchdowns? In the home goods arena, you might see more subjective benchmarks that are heavily influenced by marketing, such as rankings for the best appliances or cleaning solutions.

Benchmarking is a result of inherent competition, either internal or external. Internally, a company might set a series of records for product sales or app downloads, and compare future performance against their best results. Externally, a company might decide to compare their sales, customer retention, or other metrics to those of companies who are in the same industry.

# **Continuous iterations**

> "Great design is the iteration of good design." —Onur Mustak Cobanli, the founder of OMC Design Studios
> 

The user-centered design (UCD) process can be thought of as both linear and cyclical. It is linear in that it makes sense to start with certain steps to ease the transition into other steps. And it is cyclical in that, to continue meeting the needs of users, designers repeat the linear steps.

This is why the UX design process is iterative. Once you've identified a user need and generated ideas to meet that need, you are ready to develop a prototype. The next step is testing your prototype to see if it meets the need. What did you learn from user testing? Amend the design based on those results and feedback. This starts a new iteration of the cycle. You'll go back and create a new prototype, and then iterate until you are satisfied that you've reached the best possible product for release to market.

This iterative process is often called *rapid prototyping* or *spiral prototyping*.

# **Summary**

In order to determine how your product is performing once it is available for use, it is important to have processes and tools in place that will let you evaluate your product's performance against your goals.

Setting goals with quantifiable measures is a critical way to measure the success of your work.

# **The principles of good visual design**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify the principles and elements of visual design and describe how they are used to create positive user experiences.*

Visual design is the process of using images, colors, fonts, and textures to present information, inspire and motivate action in a people-friendly manner, and build trust for a brand or service. It consists of principles and elements that work together to create aesthetically pleasing tools or communicate information. It is important to understand visual design so that you can polish your projects and bring them to life.

# **Key terms**

- **The elements of visual design:** Color, line, space, shape, typography, texture, and alignment
- **The principles of visual design:** Unity, balance, dominance, hierarchy, scale, variety, contrast, and proximity

# **Form follows function**

Who decides what is considered good visual design? Although personal preferences can differ, most of today's standards for good design have roots in the Industrial Revolution and Modernism—both of which shaped cultural history. The mechanization of manual labor streamlined the thinking behind production and products. Driven by a desire to save on capital, people began to believe that products should be both useful and beautiful. This moved culture away from ornamental extravagance, and the desire for form following function inspired the movement for Modernism.

The influences of the Industrial Revolution led to the establishment of the Bauhaus, a German school that combined crafts and the fine arts. The school opened in 1919, but it was forced to close in 1933 due to pressure from the Nazis. Upon the school's closure, the teachers emigrated and settled around the world, where they continued to spread the school's philosophies on art and design. This is why many designs feel universal. Contemporary design follows the set of principles that Bauhaus established. These principles are formally called the *Principles of Modernism*.

# **Assignment overview**

In this checkpoint, you will learn about the principles and elements of design, and you'll start identifying them in the designs that you encounter. At the end of the checkpoint, you'll show your understanding by labeling the principles and elements in sample work.

# **Elements of visual design**

The elements of visual design are the basic building blocks or units that you will use to create visual compositions.

- **Color** is the perception of light reflecting off of an object. In design, color communicates information—such as where to take action—as well as style.
- **Lines** represent the connection of two or more points in a plane or flat surface. These may be visible lines—such as a horizontal rule on a website—or suggested lines, like the margin of a page. Lines may be straight or curved.
- **Space** is the empty area around an element. This is sometimes called *negative space* or *whitespace*.
- **Shapes** are enclosed elements with two dimensions: length and width. Shapes stand out from the space next to them because of contrasts in value, color, and texture.
- **Typography** is the technique of designing and arranging type with the goal of legibility, intrigue, and appeal.
- **Texture** in visual design refers to an implied texture in the form of patterns created by lines, shapes, colors, values, shadows, or highlights. Texture creates depth, focus, and hierarchy among elements.
- **Alignment** is created when two or more shapes or objects are situated along the same line, such as a gridline. Alignment creates visual balance between elements and can help readers' eyes follow content in order.

# **Principles of visual design**

The principles of visual design are the rules, patterns, and guidelines that form the foundation of what is considered good visual design. Many principles are based in cognitive psychology and how humans process the information around them.

- **Unity** creates a sense of harmony between all elements in a design. This achieves a sense of completeness. Good visual designs appear unified in color, mood, and style.
- **Balance** governs the distribution of elements in a design. Elements can be placed evenly or asymmetrically when following a grid. A well-balanced design will appear stable and not lopsided—even if some elements are asymmetrical. As a visual designer, you can create balance through the distribution of shapes, colors, and patterns.
- **Hierarchy** shows the difference in importance of the elements. Order, color, and size are the most common ways to create hierarchy. In UX and UI design, using a clear visual hierarchy helps readers understand which elements to read first.
- **Dominance** gives focus to a single element above others. You can make an element dominant to help create a sense of hierarchy or to show users where to take action.
- **Scale** describes the relative sizes of the elements in a design. Elements might be small scale or large scale. Scale differences can create a sense of depth or drama.
- **Variety** introduces varying elements in designs to avoid monotony. This helps keep the mind engaged when it's consuming large quantities of information. Good designs use the right amount of variety for the situation—making sure that users stay both engaged and focused. Too little variety is monotonous, while too much variety can be distracting.
- **Contrast** is created when elements appear opposite or different. For example, black and white are opposites that have a high contrast. Visual designs incorporate contrast in color, shape, size, and texture to add meaning and clarity and to create variety.
- **Proximity** is demonstrated when elements are close together. When elements are *proximate*, or close to each other, they appear to share a common meaning or purpose. Visual designs use proximity to show which labels belong to specific images, or which headings belong to specific paragraphs, for example.

# **Digital design trends**

As a new UX/UI designer, you can benefit from knowing popular digital design trends as well as digital design principles. Many visual design trends have been created to make digital products easier for people to use, and in some cases, easier for companies to build.

# **Skeuomorphism**

*Skeuomorphism* is a type of visual design that mimics elements of real-life products or features. This involves a variety of textures—like wood, stone, and velvet—applied to interface elements or static graphics. The style also relies on shadows and highlights, which are used to imply depth. In the early days of the web, skeuomorphism was first used to help people understand how to interact with user interfaces. It was impossible to know what to click, so designers made clickable elements look like buttons. The design taught people how to use the site intuitively; it built on knowledge and schemas that users already had. Once skeuomorphism helped people learn how to interact with user interfaces, it became possible to diverge more from the physical world. This development opened the door for minimalism.

# **Minimalism**

*Minimalism* is another style of visual design. This style strips designs down to their essentials. Minimalism still uses stylistic choices like shadows and highlights, but only if the design absolutely calls for it. This style inspired both flat design (developed by Apple) and material design (developed by Google).

# **Flat**

*Flat* design is a minimalist design style that removes all stylistic textures that imitate the real world. Instead, it relies on color and shape to depict the separation of elements. International typographic style, text-based user interfaces, Modernism, and the styles emerging from Bauhaus all influenced flat design. Flat design was first introduced by Microsoft with its Metro design. Since then, many companies, including Apple, have adapted the style. In 2013, Jakob Nielsen, an expert in user interface design and usability, described flat design as a "threat to tablet usability." Flat design is popular in iOS apps.

# **Material**

*Material* design was created by Google in 2014. Material design is considered an evolution of flat design; it uses minimalistic shapes and colors, but it also suggests "material" or physical layers. It uses shadows and highlights to create depth in visual designs and helps to establish a consistent UI library across all devices. Material design is popular in Android apps.

# **A little note from Dieter Rams**

Dieter Rams was a notable industrial designer who worked for Braun from 1955-1995. He designed the classic calculator shown in the image above, an **[alarm clock](https://canoe.design/products/braun-alarm-clock)**, and a **[T3 Radio](https://www.ft.com/content/65a9fc82-c515-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e)** that inspired the design for the first generation iPod. One can even say that Dieter Rams still inspires the look and feel of Apple products, IKEA products, and other big brands to this day.

As one of the more notable designers, he created his own set of design principles. Many contemporary designers reference these when creating good design. Keep these in mind as you create and improve your design thinking and skills.

Dieter Ram's **[10 principles for good design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/dieter-rams-10-timeless-commandments-for-good-design)** are summarized in the list below:

1. Good design is innovative.
2. Good design makes a product useful.
3. Good design is aesthetic.
4. Good design makes a product understandable.
5. Good design is unobtrusive.
6. Good design is honest.
7. Good design is long lasting.
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
9. Good design is environmentally friendly.
10. Good design involves as little design as possible.

# **Accessible visual design**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to describe how the look and feel of a product or service can affect its usability and accessibility.*

The definition of visual design has evolved through the continuous innovation of technology and the transition from print to digital. Visual design contains many subdisciplines, including illustration, typography, and iconography. And outside of the digital landscape, you can see visual design in the form of stop signs, event posters, and product packaging. Visual design also takes on a marketing role in advertising; it communicates information about the products and services that a company or brand sells.

As a UX or UI designer, you will be responsible for ensuring that the visual designs that you create—whether in the form of app screens or website interfaces—are accessible. Your designs should be usable by a wide variety of people, including those with vision impairments. This checkpoint will give you an overview of principles and tools that you can use to improve accessibility.

In this checkpoint, you will read about visual design in New York City's transit system, which provides an example of a visually based information system. You will also review the universal principles of visual design.

# **Assignment overview**

At the end of this checkpoint, you will complete an assignment that introduces you to a web accessibility evaluation tool. This tool, which is called WAVE, can help you identify visual accessibility issues in your visual design work.

# **Key terms**

- Accessibility
- Universal design principles

# **Case study: Visual design in New York City's transit system**

Visual design is not just about style; the careful application of basic visual design principles can also make products, tools, and services easier to use.

New York City's transit system provides an example of intuitive visual design. New York City has 22 train lines that cross through the five boroughs—and as shown below, each train line is identified by a color.

*Image source*: **[Did You Know The MTA Uses Pantone Colors to Distinguish Train Lines?](https://www.6sqft.com/did-you-know-the-mta-uses-pantone-colors-to-distinguish-train-lines/)**

Inside each station, there are many color-coded signs that help transit riders navigate the city, making the trek efficient and seamless. Inside the trains themselves, there are LED markers that indicate the current stop as well as the next stops that the train will reach.

As a UX/UI designer, you, too, will consider how color, or other design elements, support or detract from usability. You may be responsible for designing navigational pathways through digital or physical spaces. You might use color or other visual cues to help people through the process.

Stop for a moment and reflect: Are there any systems that you use now—perhaps ones that are similar to NYC's transit system—that are made easier because of visual design? What visual design elements support the experience?

# **Visual design's impact on accessibility**

Throughout your career, you will learn to design for many types of people. Each company that you work for (and product that you work on) will likely have a different *target market*, which is a set of people who have common purchasing preferences. And for any target market, you'll need to ensure that the products you design are accessible to a wide variety of people within that market. Designing for accessibility means that more people, regardless of their physical and cognitive abilities, can access the information that your product provides.

Most digital products rely heavily on visual information and visual communication. But because not all people experience vision in the same way, you will be responsible for considering and accommodating differences.

Here is a short list of characteristics that you can design for:

- Color blindness
- Low or limited vision
- Attention deficit and similar cognitive disorders
- Limited literacy
- English as a second or foreign language

When you design websites and apps, try to stop and think through how people with these characteristics would use your product. Could they use it at all? What could you enhance in order to support their experience?

There are many ways to support differences in visual ability. For example, you can adjust the color contrast, increase the general size of a design, and give users the option to enlarge elements. You can also design and write with a clear hierarchy, use clear and simple language, and provide alternative text to allow those without vision to interpret photos and other nonverbal elements.

Here are some resources to learn more about accessibility:

In the next section, you will dive deeper into accessibility by exploring the principles of universal design.

# **Principles of universal design**

Revisiting the principles of universal design will help to hone your design thinking skills.

The **[principles of universal design](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm)**, outlined below, were created by Ron Mace and a group of design researchers and practitioners in the United States in 1997. These eight core principles help professionals of all types to design products and experiences for people with a vast range of abilities.

As you read through the principles, think about how they relate specifically to visual design. Use the reflection questions to support your process.

# **Principle 1: Equitable use**

The design is useful for people with diverse abilities. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Provide the same means of use for all users.
- Avoid segregating, alienating, or stigmatizing any user.
- Provide privacy, safety, and security to all users.
- Make the design appealing to all users.

**Reflect:** What are some ways that you could use visual design to make products more equitable? And what are some ways to make the visual designs themselves more equitable?

# **Principle 2: Flexibility in use**

The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Provide choice in the methods of use.
- Accommodate right- and left-handed access and use.
- Facilitate a user's accuracy and precision.
- Be adaptable to a user's pace.

**Reflect:** How might a visual designer create more flexibility for someone using an app?

# **Principle 3: Simple and intuitive use**

The use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience and abilities. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
- Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
- Accommodate varying literacy and language skills.
- Arrange information in hierarchical order.
- Provide prompting and feedback both during and after a user completes a task.

**Reflect:** How does a visual design make a product simpler? More complex?

# **Principle 4: Perceptible information**

The design effectively communicates necessary information, regardless of the user's environment or sensory abilities. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Use a variety of methods for redundant presentation of essential information.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
- Emphasize or maximize the legibility of essential information.
- Differentiate elements in a clear way that a user can describe and articulate. For example, make it easy to give instructions.
- Provide compatibility with techniques and devices that users with sensory limitations use.

**Reflect:** What visual design elements and principles make information more perceptible?

# **Principle 5: Tolerance for error**

The design minimizes hazards and negative consequences from any accidental or unintended actions. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors.
- Provide warning signs and notifications.
- Provide fail-safe features.
- Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require focus.

**Reflect:** How could a visual design reduce tolerance for error?

# **Principle 6: Low physical effort**

The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimal physical labor. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Allow users to maintain a neutral body position.
- Use reasonable operating forces.
- Minimize repetitive actions.
- Minimize sustained physical effort.

**Reflect:** Can visual design support the way that a user physically experiences a product? Can you think of any examples?

# **Principle 7: Size and space for approach and use**

The design provides the appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of a user's body size, posture, or mobility. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Make sure that important elements are clearly visible for both seated and standing users.
- Make all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
- Accommodate for different hand and grip sizes.
- Provide sufficient space to allow for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.

**Reflect:** Are there ways that a visual design could support spatial needs?

# **Principle 8: Delight**

The design encourages positive interaction with a user's five senses. To that end, the design should do the following:

- Create a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere to promote investment and emotional connection.
- Use appropriately stylized elements to make interaction pleasurable.
- Make the experience of using the technology feel friendly and human centered.

**Reflect:** What are some ways that the visual designs of products have delighted you as a user?

# **Summary**

In all sectors of society, visual aids are used to help people understand and navigate environments, experiences, and products of all kinds. However, because people are differently abled, designers rely on universal design principles to build inclusive, accessible designs that everyone can use.

Taken together, the principles of universal design explain that good intuitive design has several key characteristics:

- It communicates clearly.
- It connects emotion with logic.
- It solves problems.
- It enacts social change and changes behavior.
- It is simple to use and understand.
- It appeals to the five senses.

This may seem like a lot to consider at this point in your student journey. But ultimately, designing successful, human-centered products is professionally important, socially responsible, and personally satisfying.

# **Designing memorable experiences**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to describe methods for using empathy as a designer. You will also be able to use the five senses theory to evaluate designs.*

# **Assignment overview**

At the end of this checkpoint, you will complete a two-step assignment:

1. Complete a five senses theory graph for two of your favorite brands that have mobile apps.
2. Create a Pinterest board to start collecting examples of inspiring visual designs.

These exercises will help you begin to reflect upon what makes designs memorable. You'll need to consider the visual impact as well as the role of the other senses. Then, later in the program, you can create memorable experiences for others.

# **Communicating emotion through design**

When you think of a memory, you likely remember a combination of imagery, sounds, texture, and scent. These sensations work together to elicit emotions, which further cement the experience as memorable. Afterward, your reaction toward that memory is based on the totality of your experience.

You already know that design can impact many areas. The sensory effect of visual stimuli means that visual design has an especially strong influence on how people experience a design. This is true for both static and animated forms of visual design. By introducing a second-level interaction—and in return, a reaction—you can make sure that your design will not only look good, but also feel good.

# **Case study: Redesigning Mondays**

When IDEO NY designers were asked by Studio 360 to participate in a redesign challenge, they created a series of products that were designed to help people look forward to Mondays. They called their project Monyay.

The first product that they created was called the Lolzzz. It was an interactive alarm clock that rocked back and forth and gently woke users with a different child's laughter every Monday.

To create this product, they used a common design process: they found inspiration, supported it with research, designed the product, and created the prototype.

The finished product was not only interactive—it reached even further. The product's experience was carefully crafted; it included an email that users could read during the commute to work, and it offered users an opportunity to build community by submitting a recording of their own laughter.

Through this real-world example, you can gather that emotion—especially positive emotion that is shared—creates a memorable experience. If you're interested, you can **[read more about the Monyay project](https://bringjoy.ideo.com/)**.

# **Designing with empathy**

Designing memorable experiences—visual or otherwise—requires designers to use empathy in their design process.

Empathy is very different from sympathy. If you express *empathy*, you are showing concern for another's well-being. If you express *sympathy*, however, you might feel pity or sorrow for the other person but can't necessarily relate to their experience.

The methods described below can help you learn to design with empathy. As you read through the methods, consider how practicing empathy in these ways can help you enhance the visual design of a product and create more memorable experiences.

# **1. Assume a beginner's mindset**

"Assuming a beginner's mind" is an idea that has origins in mindfulness practices. It means that, as a designer, you should start each project from a place of humility. Rather than assuming that you *already* know what will work best for others, you should strive to learn about people's experiences and needs first. Then, you'll use your expertise to design solutions to help meet those needs.

In visual design, starting with a beginner's mind might mean that you don't automatically assume that the latest visual trends will work for the users of your product. Creating memorable experiences for your target market might require that you deviate from trends or the latest styles.

If you have a background in graphic design, you may learn that you need to question some assumptions about high-style visual designs. The subtle contrasts, fine lines, and metaphorical representations that show sophistication in artistic visual designs might not work for apps and software meant to be used on a day-to-day basis.

In general, it's best to start the design process without any assumptions about the user's knowledge base. Creating from the ground up leads to a stronger product.

# **2. Use the five whys and the what-how-why method**

In order to understand a problem and find innovative solutions, you must ask these questions at the beginning of the process. To use the *five whys method*, start by making an observation. Then ask, "Why?" Continue this process until you've reached a solid conclusion. Here's an example of this process:

1. The house is dark.
2. Why?
3. Because the lights aren't on.
4. Why?
5. Because nothing happens when the switch is flipped.
6. Why?
7. Because there isn't a lightbulb in the fixture.
8. Why?
9. Because we ran out.

The *what-how-why method* is a similar technique that can help you identify the driving forces behind user decisions and preferences. The method starts by asking, "What?" In other words, begin by making a concrete observation of a user's behaviors or actions. In the design context, this question can take many forms. What is a user doing, looking at, or focusing on in a specific product or interface? What tools, features, or services are they using? What are they clicking, and what are they not clicking?

Then, you move from the what to the how. By asking "How?" you can uncover additional details and context about the way that the user is accomplishing (or not accomplishing!) the action. When they look at that graphic or click on that button, are they smiling? Or do they look frustrated? Are they struggling with what they're doing, or are they doing it with ease? Do they seem to know where they want to go, or do they appear aimless? And finally, you ask, "Why?" Here, you synthesize and interpret the observational data that you gathered. This question gets at the emotional catalysts behind a user's behaviors. Why were they smiling or frowning during that interaction? Why were they struggling, or alternatively, why were they moving easily from point to point? What conclusions can you draw about their feelings, beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes?

# **3. Conduct contextual interviews**

Conducting interviews is one of the primary ways that UX designers and researchers gather information. To create memorable experiences, you will want to interview a wide spectrum of people, including both potential and current users of the product that you're creating. With permission, document the interview with photo or video.

Conducting interviews can help you understand how people perceive your product and use it in their own contexts—which might be different from what you anticipated. These interviews can help you generate ideas for the appropriate visual design or test out your design assumptions. You might learn, for example, that you need to adjust the contrast or hierarchy of your visual design in order to make the product easier to use—and more memorable overall.

# **4. Build empathy with analogies**

Analogies are useful tools that you can use to compare experiences and stories, without diminishing them, to achieve a deeper grasp of the emotional landscape of the problem.

# **5. Employ photo and video findings**

To envision the entire story, it helps to see the problem. Study information that you've gathered from interviews, observe photos and videos, consult journal entries, and even draw from your own findings. You can use findings from users and from yourself.

# **6. Bodystorm**

Bodystorming is a design activity that involves enacting an experience yourself. To bodystorm, walk through a process step by step, while focusing on understanding issues, generating new ideas, and creating prototypes.

# **The five senses theory**

Designer Jinsop Lee introduced the *five senses theory* when he presented it at a week-long TED talk event in 2013. The five senses theory is a tool that allows you to rate how memorable your lived experiences are according to each physical sensation.

# **The five senses graph**

Below is the graph format for using the five senses theory. The graph has a rating system (1-10) on the y-axis. The five senses—sight, touch, sound, smell, and taste—are along the x-axis.

You can use this graph to help you think about your lived experiences and evaluate how memorable or positive they were.

# **Summary**

As you can see, designing memorable experiences requires more than creating a beautiful interface. For an experience to be memorable, it must be designed with emotion and intrinsic human behavior in mind.

# **Visual design deliverables**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify basic design deliverables and practice creating deliverables with industry-standard tools.*

As a UX or UI designer, you will likely be responsible for creating a variety of design deliverables. Especially if you're a UI designer, your team will probably rely on you to create not only rough sketches but also polished, production-ready visual design elements.

This checkpoint introduces you to some of the most common design deliverables that you'll encounter in your career as a UX or UI designer.

# **Assignment overview**

At the end of this checkpoint, you will have a chance to create one of the most common design deliverables: a wireframe. The purpose of the assignment is to give you a bit of practice creating typical deliverables using industry-standard processes and tools.

# **Design deliverables**

Below is a list of visual design deliverables that are commonly produced by UX, UI, and product designers. What each person produces depends on the company that they work for and the structure of their teams. Although you might not be responsible for creating all of these in your future job, it's helpful to familiarize yourself with their names and basic purposes. Later in the program, you will gain practice creating several deliverables.

# **Storyboard**

A *storyboard* is a graphic organizer that takes the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence. They look similar to comic strips, with sketched images above captions. Design teams sometimes create storyboards to illustrate a user journey or interactive media sequence. Storyboards can be used as preliminary visualizations for motion pictures, animations, motion graphics, or interactive media sequences.

UX and UI designers both use storyboards, although specific responsibilities vary by team. UX designers and researchers might use storyboards as a research deliverable. And UX, UI, or product designers might use storyboards to illustrate interactive sequences.

# **Wireframe**

*Wireframes* are often described as blueprints for webpages or app screens. Design teams create wireframes early in the design process to show and experiment with the layout and hierarchy of information on each page or screen. In wireframes, designers often use gray boxes as placeholders for images. And they may use different shades of gray to stand in for the final colors that will be used.

As a best practice, wireframes include authentic headings, labels, and written content, although detailed paragraph copy might be temporarily substituted with placeholder text.

UX, UI, and product designers—and occasionally user researchers—create wireframes as deliverables.

# **Prototype**

In digital design and development, *prototypes* are preliminary models of websites or apps used for usability testing. Design teams use tools such as Figma to create clickable prototypes. With these tools, designers can assemble and style pages or screens, and link them together so that they mimic working websites. Clickable prototypes are often time consuming to create, so they might be used only to test certain portions or flows of a design.

UX, UI, and product designers are typically responsible for creating prototypes.

# **Mockup**

*Mockups* are high-fidelity screen designs which are often created in single static pages. Design teams may create mockups to illustrate final designs for clients and development teams.

UI designers often create mockups that are labeled with specifications—such as specific pixel measurements—for developers. These deliverables are sometimes called *redlines* or *redline mockups* because the annotations and measurements are drawn on the mockup using red lines and labels.

# **Mood board**

*Mood boards* are collages or other collections of visual inspiration. Visual and UI designers may create mood boards as an early step in a visual design ideation process.

Mood boards can consist of images, text, colors, and samples of other elements in a composition. They communicate a visual language and style. Design teams might create mood boards in a tool like Pinterest to gather and share ideas with each other, or they might create a mood board as a deliverable in order to propose a particular visual design style to a client.

# **Style tile**

A *style tile* is very similar to a mood board, but it contains specific web elements: typographic levels, a color palette, textures, image styles, and repetitive interactive elements like buttons.

Design teams often create style tiles to propose a stylistic treatment for the digital product that they're creating. Designers typically use style tiles to engage with clients and involve them in the creation process. Because style tiles are halfway between a mood board and a mockup, they can be used to visually represent the client's brand. They can also help the team decide on design treatments, such as colors and typographic choices, before the final product is built.

# **Branding guide**

**[84colors](https://www.84colors.com/build-brand-style-guide-works/)**

A *branding guide*, also called a *brand book*, is a reference used to maintain visual cohesion across a company's products.

Traditionally, the branding guide specifies color schemes for print and digital products, typefaces, and appropriate imagery—and it describes when and how to use these elements. It typically also gives guidelines for using logos. A logo can take the form of a *logomark*, which is an image or symbol, or a *logotype*, which is stylized text. A branding guide may outline when to use the logomark, when to use the logotype, and when to use a combination of the two. It may also address logo placement and any other logo dos and don'ts.

Most UX, UI, and product designers are not responsible for creating a branding guide from scratch. They are, however, responsible for using the branding guide regularly and reflecting the brand in their work. If a designer were to design anything new for the company, they would consult the branding guide during the ideation stage.

# **Pattern library or UI guide**

A *pattern library* or *UI guide* is a system created to maintain the visual cohesion of a digital product or website. It focuses primarily on the look and feel of the user interface—the digital platform that users interact with—as well as any animations or interactions.

Though they're often, and correctly, used interchangeably, pattern libraries and UI guides *can* have slightly different focuses. Furthermore, the *graphical user interface* (or GUI, which is pronounced "gooey") is technically made up of components from pattern libraries and UI guides (and on some teams, the core system is actually called a GUI, rather than a pattern library or a UI guide). While UI guides can be a smorgasbord of stylized buttons, links, modals, and other aesthetic and functional components, pattern libraries can have elements laid out in very specific templates to make up an onboarding process or a news feed. All these bits and pieces of design make up the graphical user interface. But depending on where you work and who you work with, you may hear all three terms referring to the same fundamental tool or idea.

Like branding guides, a UI guide or pattern library can exist as a PDF file or, more commonly, as a protected online web page. UI guides cover the color scheme of the interface, the appearance of buttons and their status changes, input boxes, icons, menus, and more. UI designers are responsible for creating and maintaining UI guides and pattern libraries.

In the future, if you work on iOS applications, you'll become familiar with Apple's **[Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)** (or HIG), which is a UI guide available to the public. And if you work on Android applications, you'll become familiar with Google's **[Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design)**, which is another UI guide available to the public.

# **Tools of the trade**

Design tools evolve over time, and no designer uses just one tool. It's smart to stay up to date with the range of tools that are already out there. Below is a list of the tools that you may use during your UX/UI career. In this program, you will be using Figma, but you should also familiarize yourself with the others on this list so that you understand their similarities and differences.

- **[Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)** is a set of applications—including Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, and Animate—offered by Adobe as a subscription service. These applications are industry standards at creative agencies and major corporations like Microsoft.
- **[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)** is a software that specializes in creating vector graphics. It was originally used for wireframing and prototyping in the UX/UI process, although now it's starting to include more collaborative tools to enhance the digital design process. It was created for macOS.
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** is like Sketch in that it offers the ability to animate your prototypes—a win for interaction-focused designers. Animated prototypes can be closer to the real thing; they are great for testing with users and presenting to stakeholders. But unlike Sketch, Figma is available to use on Windows as well as macOS.
- **[Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/)** is a suite of advanced photo editing, illustration, and publishing software. It's a lower-cost alternative to Adobe Creative Cloud.
- **[IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/)** is an icon manager that allows you to export icons at all sizes to work across devices. You can import your icons from Sketch, search for bundles or individual icons, and bookmark favorites. This app is a favorite among product designers.
- **[Haiku](https://www.haikuforteams.com/)** is an open-source animation tool that allows you to create animations and then share the code with developers. This tool makes collaboration easier, and you can import files and formats from Sketch, Figma, and Illustrator.
- **[Contrast](https://usecontrast.com/)** is a neat macOS tool that checks the contrast between colors to help you design with accessibility in mind. It hides in your status bar so that you can easily access it.
- **[PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com/)** is an easy-to-use tool that is designed to help you figure out spacing and dimensions. It even lets you add guidelines that snap in place to ensure that designs are aligned.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you learned about the different deliverables used for visual design, and you explored their importance. You also read an overview of a variety of tools used in digital design and learned about their similarities and differences.

# **Design systems**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to use industry-standard tools to create a simple style tile. You will also demonstrate your understanding of design principles and deliverables.*

# **Summary of the module**

Congratulations! You are now aware of the importance of visual design as part of the user experience process. You've studied key terms, principles and elements for good design, and guidelines for best practices.

You've discovered how to create memorable experiences, and you understand the role of the five senses in products. You've also explored the design processes and deliverables that visual designers and UX/UI designers are responsible for.

In addition, you have created a small community of designers on social media. Having a community will empower your design journey and motivate you to continue expanding your knowledge. Because you're in the technology industry, it's important that you continue working at updating your toolbelt and creating best practices for your personal design process.

Feel free to revisit this module at any point during the program, and know that you're well equipped to be a key team player in your career as a designer.

# **Assignment overview**

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll create a simple style tile to gain practice with industry-standard tools and to demonstrate your understanding of basic visual design principles.

# **Visual design systems**

Visual design is the final stage in a UX designer's process. It involves branding, user interface design, iconography, imagery, and more. It is what inspires people to interact with the product, learn about it, and integrate it into their lives.

To maintain visual design consistency across products, designers and development teams often create *design systems*—unified collections of templates, components, patterns, and visual styles.

Unified design systems help speed up the prototyping, iteration, and development process. With a design system in place, teams don't have to invent visual designs from scratch whenever they want to make a change or addition to a product. These systems also function as collaboration tools. Developers, stakeholders, managers, and designers can plug into an established system and work together to create the final visual experience of the product.

For very small projects, a style tile can represent the simple design system that will be used across an app or small website. For large-scale products, teams typically create detailed UI guides and pattern libraries.

# **Atomic design**

**[Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)**

Many modern design teams now use *atomic design* when they create design systems. Designer Brad Frost introduced the concept of atomic design in his **[2016 book](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)** about the subject. He defines atomic design as "a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner."

Atomic design pulls from chemistry, which makes its concepts familiar and easy to grasp. This process offers a useful analogy for building graphical user interfaces.

There are five levels of atomic design:

- **Atoms** are basic HTML elements, like titles, paragraphs, and images.
- **Molecules** are HTML elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form molecule might consist of input boxes, buttons, and labels.
- **Organisms** are interface components composed of molecules (elements) and atoms (units). These pieces can be grouped together in organisms like headers, sidebars, or footers.
- **Templates** are page-level objects that provide layout structure and additional hierarchy for atoms, molecules, and organisms. Because the organisms are already designed, it's easy to place them seamlessly into a template. Templates can also be seen as wireframes.
- **Pages** are like prototypes. They serve to demonstrate how the content and imagery from the template can look with real content. These are often the semifinal designs that are presented to stakeholders and users for interviews.

Because its stages are labeled with hierarchy and principles of design in mind, the atomic design process makes it easy to build a graphical user interface according to these principles.

As a new designer, it can be helpful to train your eyes to see the "atoms" and "molecules" in interfaces that you encounter on a regular basis. Can you see the hierarchy and repetition in the products that you use? Noticing and understanding how products are created can enhance your systems thinking and design skills.

# **Design experiences**

# **Putting it all together: Graduating with the fundamentals**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to self-evaluate your understanding of the design process, UX design and research, UI and visual design, and usability. You will begin preparations for the next skills and concepts that you'll learn, and get ready to start building some real-world products.*

In this checkpoint, you will review what you've learned during the first three modules. You will evaluate your skills as you graduate with the fundamentals of design and prepare to begin the next series of modules. In the upcoming modules, you will apply these fundamentals to some intensive projects and real-world applications as you build your portfolio and immerse yourself in UX/UI design.

### This checkpoint is a review to help you solidify your knowledge, affirm your hard work, and prepare for the next series of modules. As you read through, try to pause at each heading and recall what you know about the topic. Consider adding notes to your design journal and reviewing some of the work that you've produced so far.

# **Graduating with the fundamentals**

Congratulations! You've worked really hard so far and absorbed so much. Remember how just a few modules ago you had no idea what the double-diamond design process was or what a card sort entailed? You are on your way to becoming a fantastic UX/UI designer and landing the career of your dreams.

As you prepare to graduate from the *Fundamentals* course, take a moment to review the knowledge bank that you've built so far. You're getting ready to enter a new and exciting segment of this program! You've immersed yourself in the fundamentals of UX/UI design, including a simple overview of the key ideas and some basic vocabulary that you will build upon for the rest of the program. Your assignments have been a bit smaller in scope to help you focus on the core concepts and get comfortable with these new skills.

# **Next steps**

During the next two courses, you will get to use this knowledge and your new skill set to create more demanding and fun deliverables. In the *UX intensive* course, you will explore the UX/UI design process in a little more detail, building on the topics introduced in *Fundamentals*. Your assignments will begin to ask more of you; you will start creating some of the things that you will need to build on the job, but you'll still have plenty of guidance.

# **Your first mock interview**

By the end of this checkpoint, you will have almost completed your first course! But before moving on to the next section of the program, you'll need to complete a mock interview that covers personal questions, your design knowledge, and your design perspective. Mock interviews are designed to assess your mastery of the concepts, ensure that you're on track to succeed in the program, and help you prepare for the job search. Don't be intimidated! These are fun and helpful experiences, where you get to interact with one of the many support people who are here to help you make it through this program with flying colors and score an awesome job.

# **Reflect and review**

# **Design thinking and the design process**

By now, you know that design thinking is a standardized process. You know that it's an empathetic approach to solving complex problems, and it was originally conceptualized with five stages.

The design thinking process can be applied in a variety of ways, and each organization can tailor it to suit their needs. Typically, this process has 3-7 phases, stages, or modes. Although design thinking processes vary in how they are applied in the real world, all variants of design thinking embody the same core principles.

The five phases, stages, or modes do not have to be sequential or follow any specific order. They can occur simultaneously and repeat iteratively. On many modern design teams, these five phases happen in iterative cycles. Or, they might happen in a condensed version, as can be seen in the double-diamond process.

How does the traditional design thinking process compare to the double-diamond process? How do you map them to each other?

# **The double-diamond design process**

The UX design process can be approached in different ways, but this program will focus on the double-diamond approach. There are four phases in this process:

- **Discover:** Conduct user research and gather data
- **Define:** Analyze data, brainstorm, and sketch
- **Develop:** Prototype and conduct user tests
- **Deliver:** Implement solutions and make high-fidelity prototypes

The UX design process is iterative, and you will rarely get the satisfaction of a finished product to hold and admire. But that is what makes UX work so fun! Throughout this program, you will get many opportunities to rethink your design decisions and rework your solutions to produce a better and more usable product.

# **User experience design**

The user experience can be defined as a person's overall experience of using a product or service. This product or service could be a website, computer program, mobile app, or something else. UX is particularly concerned with ease of use. As a UX designer, you will wear many hats and act as a valuable liaison between different departments and team members.

# **Key components and core skills of UX**

- **Research and analysis:** Before ever designing a screen or interface, it's important to understand the problem being solved and figure out who the users are. Every project starts with gathering requirements.
- **Information architecture:** Information architecture encompasses structural design, organization, and labeling of websites, intranets, mobile applications, and social media software. Information architecture aims to organize content so that it is easy to find and use.
- **Content strategy:** Content strategy refers to satisfying business requirements through content creation and distribution. This includes the words on the page as well as the images and multimedia.
- **Wireframing:** A wireframe is a simple illustration of a page's interface. It focuses on the layout, content, function, and behavior. Wireframes should be quick to make and quick to revise, so they do not typically include any styling, color, or graphics.
- **Prototyping:** A prototype is a preliminary version or draft of a product that allows a user to click through and simulate how the software will work before money and time are invested in developing the actual product. A prototype can be either low fidelity with linked-together wireframes, or high fidelity with pixel-perfect mockups.
- **Usability testing:** Usability testing entails evaluating a product or service by testing it with different users. Participants will try to complete tasks while the UX designer observes, takes notes, and sometimes asks questions. Testing the product with a prototype allows usability issues to be identified and fixed before the product is built.
- **Accessibility:** Accessibility is about designing for everyone. Evaluating accessibility will involve analyzing how well products, devices, services, or environments have been designed for people who experience disabilities. A good UX designer makes sure that their designs are usable by as many people as possible.
- **Visual design:** Visual design includes the aesthetics of a site and strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand.

# **UX research**

A user experience researcher works to understand user needs, behaviors, and motivations through a variety of techniques that focus on empathizing with the user. In companies with large UX teams, researchers sometimes work separately from interaction designers or user interface designers. But it is increasingly common to find them helping to guide the product development within diverse, multifunctional teams alongside business analysts, marketing folks, UX and UI designers, and sometimes a frontend developer.

# **UI and visual design**

UI design involves the aesthetics of a site and the strategic implementation of images, colors, typography, and other elements. Successful visual design engages users and helps to build trust and interest in the brand. Good visual design strategically implements images, colors, fonts, and other elements to enhance design and interaction and to engage users.

# **Coding and frontend design**

A UX designer doesn't need to know how to code an entire website. But they should have a working knowledge of how the backend works, an understanding of technical limitations, and familiarity with HTML and CSS. You will have the option to specialize in frontend design later in this program. If you choose this specialization, you'll learn how to to create the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that make up a user interface.

# **Projects and real-world teams**

The day-to-day work of a UX/UI designer varies greatly between organizations. In a small company or as a freelancer, a UX/UI designer may work alone. And in a larger company with a bigger budget, there might be several UX and UI designers on a team. A lean team will be more focused on execution within a limited budget or timeframe, but a more robust team may have an information architect and a dedicated user researcher. A designer on an Agile or Scrum team may work on a multidisciplinary team alongside engineers, product managers, and marketing or business professionals.

During the next two courses in this program, you will be working on projects to design an app, first for a fake client and then for a real client. This is the fun part! You will get to use the knowledge that you've acquired and put it into practice as you research, ideate, and test your app ideas. UX/UI isn't a great career path just because it is in demand and lucrative—it is also incredibly rewarding and fun to do the work itself.

As you move into the project-based work in this program, remember that there are no right answers. Try to embrace the challenges, have fun, and be playful! Playful and curious designers are the most successful, as they learn to think outside the box and innovate really good product solutions.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you reviewed what you have learned so far, and evaluated your new skills and knowledge base as you prepare for your first mock interview and to graduate from this first course.

# **Assignment**

In a few weeks, you will begin the Team Design phase of this program. Prepare for your future real-world team design project by finding a real-life client. Although you won't be working on a full UX team as part of this program, it is important that you learn to start negotiating the journey of designing for someone other than yourself. For this reason, your assignment in this checkpoint is to find a client who you will build a project for during the *Team design* modules. You have many modules and weeks to find a client, so don't panic.

But you should start searching for one now.

This should not be an actual paying client, as it's a bit too early for that kind of pressure. Almost everyone has someone in their lives—a friend, family member, or coworker—who has said that they have a great idea for a product if only they knew how to build it. Now is your chance to help them bring their idea to life.

1. Find a client, perhaps in your network of friends, family, coworkers, and fellow students. Find someone who has an idea for an app or website that you can begin to execute.
2. Interview your potential client to gather more details about their idea. It doesn't have to be a super-detailed concept, as you can help them flesh it out through the design process.
3. Try to have your client narrow the scope of their idea to something that is feasible. Your goal is to complete the research, ideation, and testing stages within a short window, and deliver a clickable prototype for your portfolio.
4. Make sure that this is a person who you can be in touch with regularly over the next several weeks or more, either in person or remotely.
5. Explain to your potential client that you will be able to deliver a limited clickable prototype of their idea, and that you will use this work as part of your professional portfolio.
6. Make sure that they are comfortable participating and allowing you to share the work that you create.

Start this assignment right now in your Design Journal by listing 5 people you will consult with to begin this process. Write down their names, why and how they might help you find a client for this project in your Design Journal and share the Notion link below.

### If you have not found a client by the time that the *Team design* modules begin, speak with your mentor so that they can help you find someone.

# **Fundamentals assessment instructions**

Before moving on to the next phase of the program, you'll complete a mock interview that covers personal questions, your design knowledge, and your design perspective. Mock interviews are designed to assess your mastery of the concepts, ensure that you're on track to succeed in the program, and help you prepare for the job search.

# **Process**

We perform the assessments remotely over teleconference, much like mentor meetings. Your mentor is not responsible for your assessments; we've delegated that task to other program representatives. Receiving an assessment from a stranger better replicates the job interview environment.

This brings us to the next point: treat each assessment with utmost seriousness. The more you commit to the experience, the more you will take out of it. Design interviews are high-pressure situations, and your future employers won't give you a practice round. That said, your assessor is invested in your success; they want to help you grow and improve. Your assessor will never belittle you or put you down. While they will try to make sure that you have a serious and realistic interview experience, they will also try to make your experience positive.

*Be mindful when scheduling your interview. You should only cancel or reschedule if it's an emergency. Treat this call like you would a real job interview. Rescheduling looks bad to prospective employers and demonstrates a lack of professionalism. Failing to attend a scheduled interview with no notice will count as a failed interview.*

# **How you're scored**

There are 33 possible points in this mock interview, and you need to score at least 27 points to pass. Each question is rated out of 3, representing the following categories:

- 3 - Exceptional: You would stand out in an interview and have a strong chance of moving to the next round
- 2 - Proficient: You would be considered for another interview
- 1 - Developing: You would not be considered for another interview

In order to obtain 27 points, you will need to obtain full marks on several questions. This is because we want to make sure that you will be as successful as possible in the competitive job search process.

# **Outside resources**

During the interview, you must answer the questions from your own knowledge. You may not look up any answers during your mock interview.

# **After the interview**

After you've completed your mock interview, you should move on to the next module while you await your feedback. You'll receive an email with your score and written feedback on your performance. If two days have passed since the interview and you haven't received your results, let your academic success manager know.

# **If you pass**

After passing this mock interview, you'll advance to the next phase of the program, where you'll begin applying your knowledge to a sustained project. Complete the *Networking careers* module before moving on to the *UX intensive* portion of the program.

# **If you do not pass**

If you do not earn a passing score on your mock interview, you'll have an opportunity to retake it. You should go over the feedback from your first interview with your mentor. Spend up to one week reviewing the learning objectives that you struggled with. When you're ready, reschedule your interview. Students who do not earn a passing score on their second attempt will schedule a call with their academic success manager to discuss the next steps.

# **How to prepare**

This mock interview will consist of questions commonly asked in real interviews. It will not cover anything that you have not been taught. For example, interviews usually ask you to answer questions about projects that you have completed. Since you haven't completed any projects yet in this program, we will not ask this during these modules. Here are some steps that you can take to prepare for your mock interview:

- Review your notes in your design journal.
- Be sure that you are comfortable with all of the keywords from the *Fundamentals* modules. Try making flashcards (if you haven't already) with the words written down to practice speaking like a UX/UI designer.
- Research common interview questions and write answers to the ones that you feel are applicable.
- Practice answering questions out loud. It can be helpful to record yourself or ask a friend to practice with you.
- Get ready to talk about UX/UI outside of just the context of this program. If you haven't started reading about design news and trends, now is the time!

**Thinkful's UX Foundations Assessment Prep Answers**

**What is User Experience Design, User Centered Design?**

User Experience is related to the product which is usually a User interface, the design, prototype and the development of the User interface, maybe even the marketing or determining product fit pre-market.

So we start with mental models, which we could brainstorm ourselves or with a team, or with outside resources. But we can start using information architecture techniques, such as card sorting, or tree sorting to see how deep the level of information goes.

As well as starting the mind maps, which will help use determine our scope of knowledge in a certain key word. This Design Research.

So starting with Personas we would do market research and determine a particular user which we create Personas or Proto-Personas. Then we can start creating Scenarios that we invision these Personas will follow, based on the research. Then we can start creating User Journeys to start creating the start and the finish of the user when it comes to the navigation of the application. So depending on this point of the process, as well as following the Design Thinking Process from IBM, this would be where we would reiterate or start creating a prototype to start testing these research assumptions.

**What is UI Design?**

Visual

So we can start with more User Experience, stuff like Mood Boards, or storyboards to get even more information about what we need to do for the User Interface of the Application.

User Interface Design, mainly web, mobile, desktop, internet browsers, mobile application, iOS, Android, Desktop Application, Progressive Web Application.

So taking this user research that we got from the user experience part of the process, we have determined many assumption, hypotheses which could have been proven to a certain extent, So now we can start designing the User Interface for the application.

So now we know who we are designing the UI for in the application, as well as knowing what the user is trying to accomplish in the navigation of the application.

We can maybe be a style guide, we get inspiration from Dribble or Behance. See what kinds of trends are relevant for UI Design in 2020, but don't be too focused on trends, because usually the application tend to be either legacy systems or they tend to be custom for businesses. For Design Systems or Web Frameworks, or CMS such as WordPress, usually we can either start from a template or from start or from some previous project.

Start with designing the mockup, based on the style guide, we can determine certain elements required in the UI, and then determining on the layout as well as thinking about the mobile responsiveness of the application if it is a web browser based application.

Using Adobe Creative Suite Software Tools such as Illustrator or Photoshop, or XD, or FIgma, we can start creating the mockups in a digital environment. Then based on the level of fidelity, or where along the Design Thinking Process we are, we can start testing the application, and then reiterating the designs of the UIs.

Then we can start with prototypes, which can be done with static image files, with simple animations, that don't have real functionality. Or we can start with prototypes that are coded with Web Programming Languages such as HTML/CSS/JS. THis is useful in the process, because we can use user testing tools for static image prototypes, but the data we can get from those prototypes is not very much. THe data we can get from the actual programmed prototype, we can get all sorts of analytics from a prototype that is actually deployed on the web.

Additionally because many of the design systems for major web applications such as Twitter, Youtube, Amazon, etc, utilize Enterprise level Web Frameworks such as Angular.JS is a JavaScript Framework from Google or React.JS from Facebook. So being able to create these prototypes on the framework from the design process is really useful, relative to a prototype built with Adobe XD which is just static images without any functionality.

**What is the difference between UI and UX Design?**

As an UX Design Intern at a mobile application startup in San Francisco, as well as working as a remote contractor for Web UI Design. User Experience is sometimes the part of UX/UI that is not as well known to the average person. It’s more of an art than a science, maybe a mix of social science, phycology, research and person to person relationship.

The main difference is that UI design is more focused on the visuals as well the functionality of the UI of the application. UX is more focused on the user who will be using the application, and about who they are and their goals.

Difference between UX and UI

**Tell me your story about what got you into user experience/product design?**

From a Fine Art Background. Took four year of art in High School in the Bay Area, and took AP Studio Art. Then after graduating high school, I got into college at Hongik University for Industrial Design in Seoul, South Korea. After attending the program, I successfully transferred to California College of the Arts in the San Francisco Bay Area for Industrial Design. But after an internship as an UX Design Intern at a mobile application startup in Downtown San Francisco in the Spear Tower, returned to college and changed majors to Interaction Design. As well as working as a remote contractor for Web UI Design, as well as in-house experience in small 1-10 business or 80 people teams in 500 corporation settings.

**Share your thoughts on design and show self-reflection?**

Design is a human experience. The way people experience design should be centered around that experience as well as focusing on empathy and compassion. Mainly because the way a particular system is designed may or not have the user’s best interested at mind. Particularly for applications which are focused more towards a corporate setting or business settings, being able to still apply design aspects to these lifeless applications to be usable for humans is what design is all about.

**What do you think about the value of UX?**

The value of UX design, can be determined in various quantitative ways for exemple how many new users are there this past week. This can be further quantified to be financial value. But this value doesn’t always come from users having the best experience. But the focus should be on giving the users the best experience, because I believe in the long run the focus on giving a good experience to the user of the application, will be more valuable than a short term plan to increase profitability. These benefits to UX may not be very clear in the the short term, but I believe that UX is an important part of the company’s culture and brand identity.

**What technologies do you think will be relevant to the UX Designers in the future?**

Coding and Programming and Engineering are skills that will be relevant to the UX Designers in the future. As well as keeping up with various software platforms or services. For example Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop or Figma. Webflow or CMS software, management tools, email campaigns tools, salesforce, analytics tools, drawing tools.

**Talk about Design thinking?**

Design Thinking is 5 step process and its more of a loop so it reiterates.

Empathy

Ideate

Define

Prototype

Test

# **Project kickoff and discovery**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify information to be collected from the UX discovery client or team ideations, scope definitions, and goal-setting workshops. You will also be able to describe the goals for the UX intensive course project, a bus app.*

# **Welcome to the *UX intensive* modules**

Congratulations on completing the *UX fundamentals*! You're now ready to apply some of the basic concepts you've learned and continue to build skills through the *UX intensive* modules.

In this part of the program, you'll work through the design process on a fictional app that helps people travel by bus. The modules will guide you through the design process, step-by-step, as though you were working for a genuine client.

You'll have the opportunity to experiment, learn what you like and dislike to refine your career objectives, and gain feedback on deliverables that you can include in your portfolio.

# **Four-part process**

This segment of the program is structured in four parts that follow a common design process: discover, define, develop, and deliver.

- In the *Discover* module, you'll conduct basic generative research for the app. You'll look at competitor models and interview potential users to "generate" ideas for your design.
- In the *Define* module, you'll document the specifications for the app and create foundational deliverables, including user flows and wireframes.
- In the *Develop* module, you'll begin refining the design by applying feedback along with visual design principles. You'll start building a high-fidelity prototype that you can use during usability testing.
- In the *Deliver* module, you'll conduct usability testing and apply changes to your design based on what you learned. You'll also have a chance to present your design and explain the rationale behind your design decisions.

# **Kicking off a project**

In this checkpoint, you'll be introduced to methods for kicking off a project. You'll also review the goals of the bus app project that is the centerpiece of this part of the program.

# **Key terms**

- Kickoff
- Discovery workshop
- Domain mapping
- Personas
- Scenarios
- User journeys
- Risks
- Minimum viable product (MVP)
- User needs

# **Kickoff meetings and discovery workshops**

As a UX designer, it's essential that you articulate and consistently restate goals for the projects you work on. A kickoff meeting or discovery workshop, held at the very beginning of a project, helps ensure that team members are focused on the right issues throughout all phases of product design and development.

Depending on the size of the project and team involved, kickoff structure and style can vary. In some cases, a small group of team leads (a product owner, design lead, and development lead, for example) might hold a client discovery workshop and a separate kickoff meeting with their internal teams. In other settings, an entire team—from client business leaders, to design and development leaders, to junior-level staff—might meet for an all-day or multiday planning session.

Later on, you'll learn how to run workshops in a sprint model. For now, focus on the type of information you should gather at the beginning of any UX design project.

# **What to learn at the start of a project**

The following portions of this checkpoint are examples of how you can structure a discovery meeting or workshop with your client and team. Each segment topic has its own key questions that ensure you build a solid foundation for your future activities.

Your primary goals are to extract ideas from the group, put them all together, and provide a unified vision based on everyone's input. If you ever work on a solo project, you can also use this framework to interview your client.

# **Part 1: Define goals**

# **Key questions**

- What are you making?
- Why are you making it?
- Do you already have ideas?

At this step, learn about the business goals of the project along with any concepts or ideas that exist so far. As much as possible, try to focus not on specific solutions at this point but on client needs and outcomes. Allow participants to discuss, sketch, or present any existing ideas that they'd like to share. Be prepared to move more quickly through the workshop segments if consensus is reached quickly, or if ideas end up being more developed than sketches.

# **Part 2: Map domains**

# **Key questions**

- What technologies can you use to make a new thing?
- What technologies are you currently using?
- What technology do you have access to?
- Who will be involved in creation? Partners, clients, funders, contractors, government entities, or other stakeholders?

Knowing the type of technology helps you understand constraints and system requirements. These constraints affect the designs you create.

# **Part 3: Identify users and their needs**

# **Key questions**

- Who are the main people who will use this product? Consider anything that comes to mind, such as demographics, characteristics, locations, and scenarios.
- Who are the secondary and tertiary users? They will have some experience with the product or something that is an input or output from the product.

Remind participants to include other people (or roles) who may be using a product on behalf of someone else. This can include people like caretakers, customer service representatives, parents, and trainers.

# **Proto-personas**

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-Proto-persona.png](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-Proto-persona.png)

Based on the user identification activity, start creating proto-personas together. A proto-persona is a sketch or simple description of a typical user based on the team's assumptions; it's used to establish initial alignment around who you *think* the user is. A proto-persona is useful in the early stages. Before it can be considered a full-fledged persona, it needs to be verified with research data in later stages.

Complete these proto-personas as a group, using blank templates that you find or create.

# **User needs**

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/User_Needs.png](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/User_Needs.png)

During this segment, put yourself in the shoes of those who will use your product. You and your team can use any information you have about current or potential users in order to determine what they need, want, and hope to achieve. You will also consider how your product helps address those needs, wants, and goals.

# **Key questions**

- What do you already know about what your primary users need, want, and hope to achieve when interacting with your product? How about your tertiary users?
- What do you still need to find out?

Once identified, the user needs can be prioritized. An easy way to start determining priority is by counting the number of times that a topic is mentioned. You can also determine priority by estimating how strongly a topic influences the creation and operation of the product.

# **User stories and scenarios**

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-user-story-mapping.png](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-user-story-mapping.png)

Use this simple format to write user stories. Think about your project and identify the following elements:

1. The actor or user
2. The product or system
3. The goal to accomplish

Then use these three elements to replace the bracketed words in the following sentence so that it fits your project:

> As a [workshop facilitator], I want a [simple persona template] so that I can [easily recreate it on a whiteboard during my workshop].
> 

Most likely, participants will think of scenarios that produce the needs that are mentioned. It's usually easier to think of situations in the context of when a need occurs.

As you talk about what users need and want in the context of *when* those needs and wants present themselves, you will find yourself going through the steps users take as they consider incorporating a product into their lives. From that, a user journey is born.

# **Key questions**

- Who is the user in each story?
- What steps do they take, or what process do they follow?
- Do these stories apply to multiple user types?
- How many stories do you need to write to cover the key functionality that address the most user needs and the highest-priority user needs?

# **Pain points**

*Pain points* are challenges that users face that cause them frustration and that may lead them to abandon the product. Use this segment to allow participants to talk about and write down all of the issues they anticipate or have seen people have while using (or consider using) a product.

# **Key questions**

**If a product has already been built and is being modified:**

- What does user feedback reveal about current usability problems?
- What frustrations and frictions have you observed during user testing?
- In what situations have you seen people struggling to accomplish a goal (with or without using a product)?

**If a product is new and is in the early stages of the design process:**

- What usability problems do your personas encounter when using similar products?
- What frustrations and frictions have you observed during comparative analysis?
- In what situations have you seen your users struggling to accomplish a goal (with or without using a product)?

# **Part 4: Refine your plan**

This section lets the team discuss any potential issues that they anticipate during the development of the project and after the product's release. It also provides time to discuss anything else that could hinder the product's successful realization.

# **Risks**

Brainstorm together and identify possible risks. Assign impact to each risk; this helps you avoid becoming discouraged by a long list of risks. For example, it may be a risk that few users share the app with friends using the built-in share feature—but how impactful is that risk to the product's overall success?

# **Key questions**

- What could go wrong?
- What are you missing that is essential?

# **Expectations**

As you discuss expectations, encourage the team to think big but remain pragmatic within the project's scope. A realistic expectation considers what is feasible within the timeline.

The team can give respect to loftier dreams but decide to save them for future iterations, when the seemingly impossible might be easier to bring into reality. You can think of expectations as similar to hypotheses—you are making a logical guess about what you think will happen based on the information you have.

# **Key questions**

- What do you expect to happen if this product is developed and launched, or if you implement the changes suggested during the workshop?
- How do you think the public will receive the product?
- How will the product team manage growth?

# **Part 5: Define scope and MVP**

# **Scope**

The project scope is essentially its boundaries—typically defined by budget. Using the information you've gathered, define a clear scope that considers user needs, business needs, risks, gaps, and opportunities. Agree on what activities, overall, you will and won't include as part of the project.

Coming to a consensus on the scope as a team empowers people as valuable contributors. It also keeps everyone focused on a realistic scope that's based on research or data.

# **An MVP**

![https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-MVP.jpg](https://curricula.thinkful.com/curricula/16bd5aba-52e0-43e3-855e-312a516a093b/uxui-uxi-discover-v1/assets2/m4_discovery_workshop/4.1-MVP.jpg)

A *minimum viable product*, or MVP, is the simplest version of a product that can be released. The idea is to quickly and cheaply produce a basic version of the new product that lets you learn how customers react to it on the market.

MVPs have become popular in fast-paced, collaborative environments, where teams move quickly to release and iterate on products that are on the market and available for use. People disagree about how useful MVPs are. Some believe that it's a bad idea to release products that only provide functionality for the highest-priority user needs. But the majority of tech-based products are expected to have fast development cycles. Stakeholders appreciate the opportunities that MVPs afford them to fail fast (or succeed fast) and see how a series of iterations perform on the market.

### In this program, your budget is defined not by cost but by the amount of time you have to complete the work. If you're in the Flex program, you can narrow the scope of your bus app project to reduce your overall time commitment. If you're in the Immersive program, you can expand the scope of your bus app project and MVP. With more time, you can dive deeper into advanced techniques and produce more refined deliverables.

# **Summary**

The process and outputs of a kickoff or discovery workshop can set the tone and guide the direction for your entire project. To create cohesion among members of a multidisciplinary team, it's essential that you allow time and space for them to share ideas, practice communicating, and agree on common goals.

# **Bus app project overview**

In this part of the program, you will work on creating a mobile app design and prototype for a bus schedule application. You'll do the required discovery, define the scope of the project, and establish requirements. Then, you'll design and deliver the project.

This project is designed to help you understand the required steps for a successful user experience design project. Here, you can read the brief and get a sense of the first steps that you'll take to kick off the bus project.

# 

# **Bus app brief**

Your client is the transportation agency for a midsize metropolitan area in the Midwest. The city has a network of public buses. They currently list the expected bus schedule on their website and post it at each bus stop. However, if you have ever used a public bus, you know that expected bus times are rarely accurate, as things like traffic, the need for longer stops to assist passengers using wheelchairs, or taking a bus out of service for maintenance can impact the schedule.

The concept of public transit trackers isn't new, but it does offer a wealth of opportunities to work with imperfect data that is important to the users of a given app or service. Few things make people run faster than discovering their bus is a mere two minutes away from the bus stop.

### It is key that you pretend you are a professional UX designer in the real world during all four modules of this UX Intensive phase. Think like a designer and try to make decisions like a designer would, based on a realistic balance of business requirements and usability.

In this exercise, you are tasked with helping to create a mobile application operated by a city transit system that serves thousands of commuters.

Transit officials have identified a problem that they want to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently added. Many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know *when* the next bus will arrive at each stop. They also want to know *how much time* they have to get to the bus stop.

Before the new routes were added, riders could simply rush to the stop when they saw a bus coming—but that doesn't work anymore because it might not be the bus that they're expecting. The city has developed a way to know how far away each bus is from a stop, but they aren't sure how to share that information with riders.

Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which is served by seven bus lines.

# **Business requirements from your client**

Here is a list of business requirements that your client has presented to you for the application you will design:

1. Ensure that any rider can tell **when** each of the buses arrives at the Washington & State bus stop.
2. Ensure that all riders can tell **how much time** they have to get to the Washington & State bus stop *before* the bus they need arrives at that stop.
3. Allow riders to select one of seven bus lines to see a list of its future arrival times at the Washington & State bus stop.

### Make sure you document and evaluate your research findings to make sure they align with these requirements. Remember, you are pretending to be a UX designer who will need to share these findings with your CEO and the business client, and clearly articulate and justify your decisions.

If your research has indicated that users have needs or wants that would require features that are *not listed* in the business requirements:

- Provide a clear rationale for introducing additional use cases and features to the application.
- For the purpose of this project, select *only one* additional feature to add to the application that is not part of the requirements.
- Once you have satisfied the business requirements, if you choose to add other features to your design, clearly indicate which features are in scope and which ones are not in scope.

# **How to complete assignments and develop your skills**

# **Use your Design Journal**

As you've been learning, a large part of building your practice as a designer is about how you approach problems and how you think. You've been using your design journal and folder to complete many of your assignments, which should help you clarify your thought process for yourself and help you share your thought process with your mentor and the grading team. Continue to practice working this way during this intensive. It will help you create a better solution and ensure your presentation will communicate your maturity and development as a design thinker.

# **Document the process**

You will be evaluated and assessed not only on deliverable solutions, but also on your *process* of problem solving. **Make sure to include notes and examples of multiple paths you considered** while completing assignments as you develop this Bus App project, and **show variations of deliverables through sketches, wireframes, and iterations**. This means you need to save sketches, user flows, and wireframes you *didn't* submit as well as ones you *did*. When the grading team suggests edits to an assignment, save the first version and all subsequent versions in an organized system within your design folder in Notion.

For example, when you submit your wireframes to your grading team, they will want to see how you made decisions and why. You will want to be able to easily show your content strategy and user flows as part of the design process and the basis for your decision making. If revisions are suggested when you submit this assignment, create a methodical and organized system for saving these iterations, such as creating a naming and numbering system for each version, so you can easily retrace your steps. As you make changes based on this feedback, take notes in your design journal to document your thought process and problem solving techniques.

And finally, always remember to prioritize the business requirements *first* along with user needs, ensuring that your product is usable, accessible, and meets the MVP requirements that were set forth in this checkpoint.

Let's repeat that for good measure: prioritize the business requirements.

# **Checkpoint**

# **Choosing research methods**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to identify common user experience research methods and structure a simple research plan.*

This checkpoint introduces you to user experience research methods, tools, and deliverables. *UX research* is the structured and systematic investigation of users and what they require, need, and expect. During the generative stage of a development process, UX research can inform the design of products and services. During the evaluative stage, it can help a team learn whether their design works as intended. Ultimately, it can reduce the cost of delivering a successful product.

UX research emphasizes taking a systematic approach to gathering and interpreting data. Researchers must methodically select and apply the most appropriate tools for gathering information.

In this checkpoint, you'll read about various methods and begin to explore how to use these to gather new data, uncover problems, and draw important conclusions. At the end of this checkpoint, you'll create a simple research plan outline for your bus app project. As an option, you can also create a formal plan and a template for future use.

# **Research methods**

With such a large variety of research methods available, it's important to know the purpose and expected outcomes for each method. This makes it easier for you to choose the best methods to answer your research questions.

In order to provide a full picture, a single project likely involves at least two different methods—such as generative and evaluative or quantitative and qualitative. Ideally, the methods you choose can help you tell a complete story that clearly illustrates the famous five W's and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how.

Following are descriptions of several types of research methods. They're listed in alphabetical order, not necessarily in order of importance or frequency of use. Keep in mind that not every research method is appropriate for every project or client. For example, it may be fun to set up an eye-tracking study, but the client or project team may not be at a stage where the results of such a study would benefit them.

# **Biometric study**

**[Biometric Study](https://econsultancy.com/are-biometrics-the-future-of-ux-testing-and-cro/)**

A *biometric study* uses tools that record and measure body signals, such as eye movements, facial expressions, and brain activity. Biometric studies give insight into how people physically and subconsciously interact with products and how they respond in certain situations.

Here are some common biometric study tools:

- **Electrocardiogram (EKG):** Measures heart activity
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** Measures brain activity
- **Eye tracking:** Tracks eyeball movements

Check out the video below for more information on eye tracking:

# 

# **Card sorting**

**[Open Card Sorting](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/demos/)**

*Card sorting* is a method that you can use to create or refine existing information architecture. Sometimes called a *card-sorting study* or *card sort study*, this research technique can help reveal the connections users see, or don't see, between pieces of information.

There are two kinds of card sorts. In *closed card sorts*, participants organize items into groups that are already created and named. In *open card sorts*, participants organize items into groups that make sense to them, and then they assign labels to the groups. Each method reveals different ways that people mentally label and categorize ideas, objects, and concepts.

# **Open card sorting**

# 

# **Closed card sorting**

# 

# **Clickstream analysis**

**[First-Click Testing Software](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/demos/)**

A *clickstream analysis* compiles data on website traffic and the paths that users take to navigate to and through an interface. For clickstream analysis, UX designers use software that is designed to track entry points, exit points, and anything that users click or tap on while they are active within the interface. This software generates a *heat map* that shows where users tend to click, how far they scroll through the interface, or where their cursors pause.

# **Cognitive walkthrough**

**[Cognitive Walkthrough Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edqjao4mmxM)**

A *cognitive walkthrough* evaluates the design of a user interface. It pays special attention to how well the interface supports learning through exploring without guidance—like during first-time use without a tutorial. For this kind of evaluation, reviewers go step-by-step through common intended tasks. You can do a cognitive walkthrough with just about anyone in the early stages of design, before you have anything beyond sketches. Then you can do it again when you're ready to test actual performance.

# **Collaborative and participatory design**

**[Read Write](https://readwrite.com/2018/05/22/participatory-design-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-be-using-it/)**

*Participatory design* is a method that lets participants construct ideal experiences. Participants use design elements and creative materials to express what matters most to them and why. You can also use this method internally, with stakeholders and various team members as participants, in order to focus and align business goals and make collective decisions.

An example of participatory design is a collage study, where participants use a common set of images and words to invigorate their imaginations. This can help them convey feelings and ideas that likely would have been more difficult to conjure without stimuli.

# **Competitive analysis**

**[Social Channel Matrix](https://www.thatsjournal.com/social-media/social-media-seo-and-sem-competitive-analysis-using-rivaliq)**

A *competitive analysis* is a method and a deliverable that can give you insight into the industry that your product or service belongs to.

You can use a competitive analysis to accomplish the following tasks:

- Identify direct and indirect competitors
- Learn how the industry works
- Find out how your competitors are improving
- Develop strategies to improve your product or service

# **Diary study**

**[Diary Study Tools](http://johnnyholland.org/2010/07/mobile-diaries-discovering-daily-life/)**

You can use a *diary study* to learn about pain points within an existing product or service. In this type of study, participants record and describe the aspects of their lives that are relevant to the product or service.

Effective diary studies are typically *longitudinal*, which means that participants record information on an ongoing basis that can range from a few days to several months or even years. Diary studies are often combined with interviews and surveys.

# **Ethnographic study**

**[Ethnographic study example](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/7-simple-ways-to-get-better-results-from-ethnographic-research)**

During *ethnographic field studies*, researchers meet with participants in their natural environments. They observe participant behavior inside and outside of the context of product usage. The purpose is to gain insight into the overall personal and social ecosystems into which the product will be introduced. Use this type of study when you want to learn not only how people will use a product, but also the broader ramifications that the product use may entail.

Ethnographic studies are considered one of the best ways to determine how people interact with the product without test bias or influence. They are also convenient for the user. They can feel less like studies, which are often associated with controlled environments and rigid stipulations.

# **Focus group**

**[You X Ventures](https://unsplash.com/photos/Oalh2MojUuk)**

Focus groups are often used in market research. In a *focus group session*, a small group of participants shares their thoughts, views, experiences, and opinions among the group. Groups can be brought together to simply discuss ideas. But you can also provide groups with *stimuli*, which are things that participants can react to and respond to, such as a product prototype or a food sample. Feedback from a small population-representative group can offer insight into how the larger population may receive a new experience, service, product, or concept.

# **Heuristic evaluation**

**[Heuristic Evaluation](https://uxknowledgebase.com/heuristic-evaluation-897bcd3ffcf4)**

A *heuristic evaluation* or *heuristic review* is a method and deliverable that allows UXers to evaluate an interface based on an agreed-upon set of basic standards. This can help you determine if a site, app, or other screen-based system can be considered usable.

This method can only be performed on existing interfaces because it considers how the system operates and responds from the beginning of a task to the very end. If a review is performed on an unfinished product, the review is likely to reveal issues that already have solutions that just haven't been implemented yet.

# **Interview**

**[WOC in Tech Chat](https://unsplash.com/photos/vzfgh3RAPzM)**

A *user interview* is a moderated one-on-one discussion with a participant. This method is designed to reveal details about a topic, process, product, or service, directly from the perspective of a current or potential user. Interviews can be conducted in person or virtually.

# **Multivariate and A/B testing**

A *multivariate test* involves showing participants variable design elements or content structures of a product. The idea is to gauge which version is the most appealing. Multivariate tests offer several variables for one concept. *A/B tests* or *split tests* are similar, but they offer only one variable for participants to choose from.

# **Survey**

*Surveys* assess user feedback on concepts, products, and services. They can be used to better understand user desires, preferences, usage experiences, and pain points. They may also gather demographics and explore how people assign value. To achieve statistical significance, try to survey at least 30 users in each segment. When it comes to surveys, it's always better to have more participants.

Surveys are typically free or inexpensive to make and use. They take minimal time to create, and they are easily accessible to remote users. You'll receive survey results asynchronously, and then you can quantify and analyze them.

A drawback to surveys is that what people say can differ from what they actually do. This discrepancy between words and actions can often yield inaccurate results. Poorly worded questions can also affect a user's response, which is a phenomenon known as an *interviewer effect*. Also, many people dislike taking surveys, which can create a skewed demographic pool. This is why it's important to create a short survey so that users are more inclined to participate.

Incentives that are attached to a specific outcome should also be avoided, as they could influence users to answer questions in a certain way. On the other hand, impartial incentives such as raffles can be great motivators.

# **Task analysis**

**[Task Analysis Process Example](http://software-engineer-training.com/task-analysis-analyze-and-improve-employee-performance/)**

A *task analysis* is the process of learning about ordinary users by observing them in action, as they perform tasks, to understand in detail how they do what they do to achieve their intended goals.

Task analysis helps identify the tasks that interfaces must support. They can also help refine or redefine your product's task flows.

# **Tree test**

**[UserZoom Tree Testing System](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/)**

*Tree tests* evaluate the findability of topics within the information architecture, without context from navigation aids or visual design cues. To clearly see trends with this method, aim for a minimum of 30 participants. Ideally, try to recruit more than 50 participants.

# **Usability test**

**[Usability Testing 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/)**

A *usability test* is a common task-based UX research method that involves giving a group of participants a set of tasks to complete, as well as a brief list of prompts, directives, or questions. While each participant completes the tasks, the researchers observe, take notes on their observations, and allow the users to share their thoughts.

# **Creating a research plan**

Once you have solid direction based on the research questions that you want to answer, you're ready to create your plan of action. Research plans should address the following topics:

1. **Background:** Why is this research needed? What led to the decision to conduct research? What stage is the project or product in?
2. **Goals:** What is the intended outcome of the research?
3. **Questions:** What are the key questions that this research will answer?
4. **Methods:** Which activities are appropriate for the goals of the project? How will these activities work?
5. **Recruitment plan:** Who will the participants be? How will they be recruited?
6. **Timeline:** When will the research activities occur?
7. **Resource needs:** What support will be needed? For example, what kind of budgetary needs do you expect? Will you use designated observers?

A research plan is a goal-setting and communication tool. It's important to create a research plan to share intentions with stakeholders, let them know what you will and won't learn through a study, and identify areas that your team still needs to uncover. A research plan also provides a structure that you can circle back to when you report to stakeholders what you learned.

# **Summary**

UX research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. In this checkpoint, you read about some of the most common, repeatable, and recognizable research methods and learned what topics to put into a research plan.

Later in this module, you'll have a chance to practice three of the most widely used research methods: competitor reviews, surveys, and interviews.

# **Competitive analysis**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to perform a competitive analysis and explain why this activity is a vital part of the design process.*

In the previous checkpoint, you completed your own draft of a research plan that included three research methods:

- Competitive analysis
- User surveys
- User interviews

Practicing these methods can help you develop skills in some of the most common and low-barrier methods for data collection. In this checkpoint, you'll take your first steps by learning how to put together a competitive analysis. At the end of the checkpoint, you'll show your understanding and gain valuable design input by completing an informal competitive analysis for your bus app project.

# **Breaking down the competition**

**[Competitive Analysis Example](https://unsplash.com/photos/S8XDzdF4Tf0)**

In the research stage of design work, it's beneficial to explore your competitors' products. If you have an existing product, you can compare your product's features to the competition and discover what works and what doesn't. If you don't have a product yet, the competitive analysis is even more valuable. A *competitive analysis* can show you what the expected features are and illuminate areas of the market that aren't being adequately served.

Here are a few questions that you can investigate:

- How does the competition position themselves?
- Who is their primary audience? What user groups are they targeting?
- What are their key features or differentiators?

# **Positioning**

When you evaluate competitors, you are trying to determine how they *position* themselves. What are they trying to tell the world?

Ask yourself the following questions as you begin your study:

- What product or service is my competitor selling?
- How are they selling it?
- What are they doing to communicate their product or service to customers? Is it effective?

# **Primary audience**

By exploring your competitors' websites, you can usually figure out their target market. If the content is well-written and clear, you can identify the types of users that they are targeting. Pricing can also be an indicator of the target market.

Ask yourself the following questions to determine the audience that your competitor is trying to attract:

- Is the product or service aimed at consumers or businesses?
- What does the product cost?
- Is there a single price for the product, or are there multiple pricing options?
- Does their copy or imagery reference or appeal to a particular niche, profession, or demographic?

# **Differentiators**

When analyzing competitors, you also want to determine how they *differentiate* themselves from one another. Your analysis provides insight into how to stand out from the existing competition. It can also give you ideas for additional features that you hadn't considered.

Ask yourself the following questions as you consider ways to stand out from your competition:

- Does this competitor have a feature that my users would find beneficial?
- If I add a new feature to my product, will this make my offering more complicated? Will my product feel bloated?
- What would this new addition cost in terms of time and money?
- Can I eliminate anything from my product and still stand out from the competition?

# **SWOT analysis**

A **[SWOT analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis)** is a structured form of competitive analysis. *SWOT* stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis takes a statement about the competitor and assigns it to one of these four categories based on whether the statement is something inherent to the company (internal), or if it is something about the market (external). It also considers whether the statement is a positive or a negative for the company.

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/c636dc1854e946fd8b6266160d9c5b10)

When you perform a SWOT analysis, you should identify and analyze up to three competitors.

# 

# **Internal factors**

When you start studying any market environment, you have to accept that existing competitors control certain aspects of the situation. By defining the current strengths and weaknesses of your competition, you gain a better understanding of what your competitors are doing right and what they are doing wrong.

# **Strengths**

Create a list of things that your competitors are doing right. A sample list of strengths could look like this:

- Effective messaging
- Obvious calls to action
- Relevant content
- Intuitive navigation structure
- Responsive design

# **Weaknesses**

Create a list of areas where your competitors appear to be lagging behind. A sample list of weaknesses could look like this:

- Ineffective messaging
- Hidden calls to action
- Irrelevant content
- Confusing navigation
- Loading issues on tablet devices

# **External factors**

Markets can be volatile. You have to be aware of things outside of your control that could create opportunities or pose a threat to your business.

# **Opportunities**

Your product may be similar to others in the market. However, by exploring your competitors' weaknesses, you can determine how to target a niche audience or find some other way to engage users. A sample list of opportunities could look like this:

- Untapped markets
- Modern design trends to better convey your message or values
- Unique marketing tactics

# **Threats**

The marketplace produces and influences threats. Figuring out how to capitalize on your competitors' weaknesses and take advantage of opportunities that you see in the market will improve your competitive edge. A sample list of threats could look like this:

- Markets saturated with new competitors
- A change in customer needs
- Competitors copying your features

Although it may seem valuable to match every feature that you see from your competitors, the first version of your product should only include the necessities. Creating a *minimum viable product* (MVP), which is the most basic, but functioning, version of a product, means just building features that are necessary for the beginning. An MVP delivers a solution to a problem with a working product that has the fewest number of features possible. Once you've got that, you'll add features as you continue to tweak and refine your product. By prioritizing your features, you can determine which features are your must-haves. Taking this approach to your product design will help you launch your product faster.

# **Under a microscope**

It's important to answer the *why* questions during a competitive analysis, but you shouldn't stop there. Move on to the *how* questions. Now that you've discerned the meaning behind a design decision, look at how your competitor executed. Did they do a good job? Did they hit a key point in a compelling way? Or did they let some other business concern crowd out a user-focused feature?

When evaluating digital products, you can learn a tremendous amount about a competitor by creating user flows for their product and analyzing them. By following a flow yourself when you try out their product, you can identify what their priorities are. Where are they pointing users? You can also identify weak points, which are the things that they've deprioritized or buried farther down in the product. Analyzing competitor user flows will be beneficial later on when you begin your own design process. If you document the flows, you can use them as a guide that shows you what to imitate and where to differentiate.

# **Summary**

You explored how looking at the competition is an important research step to differentiating your product so that users choose you over the competition. You learned how to complete a SWOT analysis and considered how mapping a competitor's user flows can reveal important decisions and design directions.

# **User surveys**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to create surveys that efficiently collect data from potential users.*

One of the ways that you can gather the information that you need for a design project is through user surveys. In this checkpoint, you will learn how to craft a survey. As an option, you can also create a survey, gather data, and analyze the results. From this process, you'll gain insight into user behaviors, needs, and demographics.

# **Key terms**

- Screener
- User surveys
- Demographics
- Conditional logic

# **Designing a survey**

You'll use your *user survey* to gather key information and capture important data about your users. Before you begin creating a user survey, you'll need to craft a basic set of questions that you hope the survey helps you answer—which means that you need to have a project or problem in mind.

If you wanted to begin researching an emerging technology, like **[wearables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology)**, you might start with these questions:

- What does the user consider a wearable to be?
- Does the user see any benefits to owning a wearable?
- Does the user have any concerns about wearable ownership?
- What future applications for wearables does the user find interesting?
- Does the user own any wearables?
- What devices does the user own?
- What is the primary reason for the devices that the user owns?
- Why doesn't the user own a wearable?

When designing products for businesses, you’ll typically also want answers to relevant questions that identify the participant's market segment:

- What is the participant's profession?
- How old is the person?
- Where does the person live?
- How can you contact the participant later for follow-up questions?

Check out the video below and we'll walk through creating a user survey with Google Forms:

# 

# **Crafting the questions**

It may be tempting to take the previous questions and merely ask the user for yes or no answers, but that won't produce the most robust set of user data. How you ask questions—and the ways in which you allow the user to answer—impacts the kinds of answers that you receive. You can use methods that guide the user and help them finish the survey more quickly.

There are many things to take into account when you're considering how you allow the user to respond. Following are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

- Offer users multiple-choice options whenever possible. It's always easier to sort data that you offer to the user to select from, rather than data that you ask them to supply.
- Never ask a user a follow-up question about a topic that they've already said isn't relevant to them.
- Only use free-form text entries for questions where it matters that each user has a unique answer or expresses it in their own words.
- Include an "other" response field in all multiple-choice questions. This lets users enter data that doesn't conform to your survey.
- Limit your survey to around 15 questions, including demographic questions.

# **Providing multiple-choice options**

When you provide users with multiple options to choose from, you reduce the cognitive load required for them to answer your question. The smoother you make the experience, the more likely it is that they'll complete your survey. Providing the user with options makes your questions easier to answer. It also makes data analysis significantly easier after the survey is complete.

# **Using conditional logic**

When users abandon a survey, it costs you time, and you lose an opportunity to collect that feedback. On the job, it can also bite into your budget. Limiting survey abandonment should be a high priority. Few things lead to users abandoning your survey more quickly than asking them to answer a question that doesn't apply to them. If you use **[conditional logic](https://www.guidingtech.com/add-conditional-logic-google-forms/)** properly, it can eliminate the risk of asking a user to answer a question that doesn't apply to them.

# **Seeking personal information**

It's always important to know who has taken your survey. You can use information about age, gender, occupation, and location to determine the different user personas that you'll create later in your research process.

You should typically ask for *demographic data* at the end of your survey. Answering demographic questions is often tedious for participants, so if you start with demographic questions, there's a risk that people won't finish your survey. If a person has already invested time in answering more interesting questions at the beginning of a survey, they are more likely to *also* complete demographic questions at the end.

# **Test your survey**

Creating a survey usually costs you only the time and effort you spend on the task—but there *is* a real cost to deploying a broken or incomplete survey to the masses. You should always test your survey with a colleague before you deploy it to a broader audience.

# **Deploying the survey**

Creating and testing your survey is only part of the task. You still need to get that survey in front of users who can provide you with the data that you need to steer your project.

If you are using Google Forms for your survey, you can share the work you created by clicking the **Send form** button. You then have the option of grabbing a link that you can send to others, or you can share the link via email directly from the form.

Where you deploy your survey often depends on your budget.

# **Recruiting participants**

When you have no budget, you'll likely lean on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to generate responses. In this program, you are always encouraged to ask your peers in the student Slack channel as well.

You can also consider using prebuilt survey communities. **[SurveyTandem](http://surveytandem.com/)**, for example, is a stand-alone community that only requires survey creators to enter some basic information to get started.

Many students have received valuable feedback on Reddit, a hub of user-generated useful (and not-so-useful) information. You can start your journey into Reddit by posting your survey into the **[SampleSize subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/)**. This probably won't generate the high number of responses that you'll want for your projects, but it allows you to work your way into Reddit and see how others present their surveys in those communities.

In professional settings where you have a budget at your disposal, you can use paid sites such as **[UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/)** to get easy access to potential users. A company may also be able to host a survey on its own platform and offer compensation or rewards for completing a survey.

# **Creating a screener**

You'll need to create a participant *screener* as part of your survey. A screener is a document that specifies the criteria and characteristics that your participants need to match to be representatives of your target population. Use a screener to make sure that you are being efficient with your time and resources, so you get feedback that accurately informs your design process.

For example, if your product is intended for use by adults in a certain age group, the majority of your participants should fall into that age group. The rest should represent secondary user groups who may not directly use the product, but support its use.

You can give a screener to a recruitment company that you use to obtain participants, or you can include it at the beginning of your survey. If you use a service that charges for each participant that completes your survey, it's especially important that only the target participants are included in the survey. If you include the screener as part of your survey, you can use conditional logic to make sure that participants who aren't part of the target demographic can bypass questions that don't apply to them.

# **Survey timing and analysis**

Although the results from a user survey can stretch on for weeks, you'll collect the majority of your results within the first 48 hours after deploying it to a specific audience. You can restart that clock every time you push your survey into a new channel for feedback.

Once that 48-hour window has passed, you can begin to analyze the results. Any analysis done sooner would be premature in most cases.

# **Participant count**

The number of participants who take your survey is very important. Although small participant counts don't doom your research findings, you should always strive for more than 20 participants in any survey that you conduct.

# **Analysis**

Later in this program, you'll learn a lot more about data analysis. At this point, the key thing to note is that trends should always present themselves in the data that comes back from any survey that you deploy.

Even very bland topics generate feedback that highlights a preference, concern, or cause. Because most surveys store their data in spreadsheets, you can quickly display that data using charts within the spreadsheet. Charts make it easy to begin spotting trends.

Google Forms can save data collected in a spreadsheet. To create a summary of the results, click **Form** and select **Show summary of responses**. You'll see a series of charts, graphs, and text that might look like the previous graph.

Your clients and colleagues depend on you to identify trends in your data. When you provide a summary of your findings, they won't have to dig through your data.

The depth of your survey analysis can vary depending on the scope of your project, but you should always provide some analysis with any survey you conduct. As the designer, you are in the best position to make sense of the information collected.

# **Pill•bug example**

Following is a project brief provided by a team building a new app: Pill•bug.

# **About the project**

Pill•bug is a mobile app that is targeted at seniors who use technology to remind them when to take their medication. Seniors taking multiple medications at different times of day need an efficient and flexible way to remember their medications. Low-tech solutions like daily pill boxes lack customization and don't prompt the user.

# **Project goals**

To create a highly user-friendly app that becomes the trusted solution to medication management.

# **UX designer deliverables**

The UX designer on the project created and conducted a survey to help the team conduct user research for their project. Take some time to go through the survey and response data:

1. Review the **[user survey](https://tf-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-curric/design-programs/Pill%20Bug%20User%20Survey%20Questions.pdf)**.
2. Feel free to submit multiple responses to the **[live user survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnMdWlug7nkEnnVq_fALdXnzsUf5N_ObPrEiq4ZaxxLbeeog/viewform?usp=sf_link)** to get a sense for how the conditional logic alters the user's experience. Your submissions will not alter the example data. Notice how the survey includes a built-in screener.
3. Look for trends in the **[response data](https://tf-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-curric/design-programs/User%20Survey_%20Medication%20Reminders%20Responses.xlsx)**.

# **Summary**

# 

In this checkpoint, you've taken a deep dive into user survey creation. You discovered that best practices include writing questions that will help reveal insights without bias. You learned additional techniques to improve your survey's quality, including conditional logic and data validation. You explored how to recruit users and review their responses.

# **Conducting interviews**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to prepare for and execute research interviews to better understand the needs of your target audience.*

In this checkpoint, you'll learn how to create and gather materials and tools for conducting interviews. You'll also learn how to conduct research interviews.

You know how to explain the importance of research, and you understand that research leads to a better overall design. Now it's time to put that knowledge into action. Conducting research is a skill; you can get really good at it when you practice it correctly and frequently.

This checkpoint introduces you to actions that you'll take, skills that you'll develop, tools that you'll use for sourcing or creating what you need to conduct a research study, and deliverables that you'll produce to share findings. This checkpoint focuses on conducting interviews with users. However, many of these principles can be applied to any research activity that you might want to conduct with participants, such as preference tests and usability tests.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll complete an assignment:

1. Create and gather the materials that you need for conducting interviews to learn about potential bus app users.
2. Follow your plan to execute your research interviews.

# **Key terms**

- Session guide (also known as a moderator's guide, discussion guide, script, or protocol)
- Recruiting
- Consent

# **Step 1: Revisit research goals and make a research plan**

Before beginning any research study, clarify your goals. As you begin preparing to interview participants, you should determine answers to the following questions:

1. Why are you conducting this research?
2. What do you want to learn?
3. How will you use what you learn?
4. What are the client's goals?
5. What context and background information do you have about the project?

Next, organize this information into a research plan. Outline exactly what you intend to do and explain how your interviews help you achieve your research goals. Your research plan serves as an overarching guide that clarifies how your research activities support your research objectives. You can follow the structure you learned in a previous checkpoint.

# **Step 2: Prepare materials**

:

**[CoWomen](https://unsplash.com/photos/UUPpu2sYV6E)**

Before you even start your first interview, you'll need to prepare your materials and set up.

You can start by choosing an interview environment. You can conduct interviews in person, in a market research lab, at a development site, or virtually through videoconferencing software. If you need to arrange or set up anything to prepare your interview environment, do this ahead of time.

You should also create or gather all the materials that you'll need to find, contact, and interview potential participants. Make sure that you have the following materials ready to go.

# **Recruitment plan**

Your *recruitment plan* should include where you will find participants, how many participants you need, and a screener to find the correct participants. Unless you can hire a recruiting company, you may be responsible for finding participants yourself.

In general, interviews are conducted with relatively few participants. This is because they are more time-intensive and difficult to recruit for than broader methods such as user surveys. A common tactic is to conduct a survey study first and ask participants if they're willing to be contacted for follow-up interviews. Using participants who completed your survey first means that they are prescreened, and you can use survey answers to identify participants who might be able to provide useful information on data trends that you observed.

Watch the videos below to learn more about DIY Recruitment:

# 

# 

# **Consent forms**

A *consent form* is a release that a participant signs to indicate that they have agreed to do the interview. It usually explains the ways in which the participant's data will be used. Consent forms require participants to sign, date, and confirm that they are over the age of 18. Working with minors is more complex and requires the consent of a legal guardian.

You can visit the **[resources section of Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates.html)** for some examples of general consent forms that you can use or adapt.

# **Session guide**

Your *session guide*, or *protocol*, should include a materials checklist, an interview schedule, and an interview script. This is meant to ensure that you remember to ask all the questions to which you need answers, in the way you want to ask them.

Using a session guide keeps you focused and on track with timing. It will also remind you to share all the aspects of a product on which you want feedback and help you avoid common mistakes. For example, your protocol can remind you to avoid leading the interviewee with words that may suggest how they "should" answer a question. It can prompt you to listen actively and allow interviewees to respond naturally and without bias.

A session guide should include everything a facilitator needs to know to run the interview properly. Following is an outline of a possible guide and explanations for what to include.

Check out the video below and we'll walk through how to create a session guide, together:

# 

# **Materials checklist**

Compile a list that clearly outlines everything that needs to be gathered for the interview. This likely includes any physical supplies such as paper, writing utensils, whiteboard, or note cards.

# **Consent forms**

Include the participants' consent forms.

# **Interview schedule**

Include the times, dates, locations, and interviewee information for the facilitator.

# **Interview script**

Interview questions, prompts, and important information should be written word for word. It may also help to break the script into sections with time estimates and include stage directions for any actions that the interviewer needs to take.

The script should include instructions all the way through the end of the session, including the exit information to give the participant. Specify what the interviewer should do with any materials that they collected or used during the interview.

Anything that is not critical to the interview, such as pleasantries, does not have to be prescribed word for word. For example, an item in the script could be, "Greet and introduce yourself to the participant."

# **Guidelines for creating interview questions**

Interview questions are designed to allow participants to answer much more in-depth than in surveys. It is important to craft your questions with care. Consider the following guidelines:

- Avoid questions that appear leading or seem to express opinions about a behavior.
- Avoid closed questions, which may only elicit yes-or-no responses.
- Ask questions that evoke what, how, and why users do things.
- Ask questions that evoke what, how, and why users feel about things.
- Make sure that questions are as clear and succinct as possible.
- Ask only one question at a time, and include all follow-ups as separate questions.
- Just as you create conditional logic in your surveys, consider follow-up questions that will only be asked if a participant gives a specific answer to a previous question.
- Prepare more questions than you think you will have time for. Clearly indicate which questions are vital and which can be skipped if time is short.

# **Step 3: Review plan with the client**

Allow your team to review and contribute to everything that you intend to ask users. Consider input from all aspects, but remember to focus on answering the research questions. Avoid tangential topics unless you're doing generative activities. Then review your research plan with the client in order to set common expectations.

# **Step 4: Contact participants**

**[Gmail](https://unsplash.com/photos/N82naZ0N4TY)**

At some point, you—or whoever you delegate or hire—will have to have some kind of direct contact with participants, either in person or virtually. Direct contact could be an email sent from the researcher or recruiter to the participant, or a physical greeting at the activity location. Either way, it is important to make sure that the participants know the following information:

- Who you are and what you do
- Why they are being included
- How you got their information or why they are being contacted
- What to expect when they participate

Be sure to remind users how and where the research results will be shared, because you'll need their consent first. They should have an opportunity to tell you their preferences for how they will allow their likeness or responses to be shared. You may contact your company's legal department to create or use a premade consent form, or you can create or find one that clearly outlines the aforementioned points.

# **Step 5: Confirm logistics**

It happens to the best of us: You have a beautiful research plan and a list full of participants—but you mixed up your time zones. Double-check your reservations, meeting room links, and any other logistical preparations that you've made for your participants. At some point in your career, you're bound to face last-minute cancellations, technical difficulties, or other complications that prevent everything from going exactly as planned. Although these situations are generally unavoidable, you can prepare so that you can recover or pivot quickly to keep things moving.

# **Step 6: Conduct interviews**

**[Conducting Interviews](https://unsplash.com/photos/5QiGvmyJTsc)**

Conduct a dry run or a rehearsal with a volunteer. Go through an entire session, as you would with an actual participant, to make sure that everything goes as planned. Provide the session schedule to the client and anyone else working on the study; encourage them to listen or watch as silent observers and experience the research themselves. If you're using recording equipment, check that all the technology is working as intended.

# **Pill•bug example**

Remember the Pill•bug team? After reviewing the data from their user survey, the UX designer working on Pill•bug decided to focus on a couple of key areas through user interviews. The designer wanted to better understand the pain points that potential users face, as well as any barriers that they might have to technology adoption. The designer's goal is to understand what features and design factors will be important. You can review their **[questions and transcripts of their interview here](https://tf-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-curric/design-programs/Pill%20Bug%20Follow%20Up%20Interviews.pdf)**.

# **Summary**

Prepare research materials such as protocols or guides. Review the plan and materials with your stakeholders and teammates. Use a screener to refine your participant pool. Confirm your session logistics prior to conducting activities.

# **Assignment**

# **Research interviews**

In this assignment, you'll practice preparing for and conducting user interviews. You can interview anyone, including your fellow students, but it is recommended that you use the same participants that you used for your user survey. Complete the following tasks using Google Docs or a similar tool.

There are two parts to this assignment. Spend up to three hours working on these tasks.

For part one, create the interview materials that you'll use to conduct user interviews, including the following assets.

- **Recruitment plan and screening criteria**: Who will you interview and why? Consider using the participants from your user survey.
- **Consent form**: Ask for permission to record the session. You can write your own consent form or use an open source version.
- **Session guide**: Include a materials checklist, interview schedule, and interview script or discussion guide. Feel free to add any other information that you feel you need.
- **At least five interview questions**: Make them relevant by tying them back to the project brief and to any surveys you've already conducted.
- **Optional**: Review your interview questions with your mentor before you interview any participants.

For part two, interview between one and five participants. After your interviews, identify three key takeaways from your interviews that impact the direction of your project. Create a simple report by writing these findings at the bottom of your session guide.

When you are finished, share a link to your file, which should include your session guide and key takeaways.

# **User personas**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to use results from user surveys and interviews to generate personas.*

The purpose of user-centered design is to design with the users in mind, and *personas* help designers focus on their users. Personas are an elaboration based on actual user data. You can use personas to put a name, face, and backstory to potential users. Personas help you maintain your commitment to designing for the end users; they help mute the internal voice that tells you to design something just because you like it.

Remember, your project isn't about you. It's about the users.

You want to better understand the users' goals, behaviors, and potential interactions with the product you're building. By empathizing with the users, you can make design decisions that will meaningfully impact their lives. But empathy can be difficult if you're only thinking about a nebulous user. Personas are meant to help you better empathize with the user because they give you more specifics to anchor your empathy.

Personas can also help with the following processes:

- Refining and finalizing requirements
- Creating designs focused on solving real user problems
- Validating your concepts
- Developing a script for usability tests

# **How personas are created**

The foundation of every persona is based on data collected about the current and potential users of a product.

In the 1980s, **[Alan Cooper](https://www.cooper.com/about-us/our-story)** was part of a movement that began designing software with an individual user in mind. His main contribution to the campaign was the development of personas. The advent of these personas led Cooper to develop the concept of **[goal-directed design](http://www.dubberly.com/articles/alan-cooper-and-the-goal-directed-design-process.html)**, which featured personas at the core of the process.

Personas are typically constructed as a composite of a potential user. In other words, they're a combination of traits found in multiple users. They aren't intended to represent any actual individual user.

### Remember, a persona is not a description of any one real person. A persona is a fictional character that you create to embody the characteristics of your users.

You'll need to collect user data in order to create this composite. There is no single right way to go about this, but most designers follow these general steps:

1. Determine the essential traits that you want users to possess.
2. Observe and interview some people who align with your desired user base.
3. Find patterns in the collected responses and use them to group people and goals together.
4. Distill those patterns into common behaviors and traits.

The common behaviors and traits that you identify will help you understand the desires of your target users. From this point of understanding, you can create user-centered designs to share with your teammates and project stakeholders.

# **The persona template**

A persona template usually includes the following elements:

- **Name:** What's the name of the imagined user that you're describing? Giving them a name will help personify them.
- **Role:** What behaviors could describe them? For example, their role might be "working parent" or "busy teen."
- **Basic demographic information:** How old are they? What is their occupation? What is their gender? Where do they live?
- **Bio:** Who is this person, and what do they do? Provide some background on the person, but keep it brief.
- **Motivations:** How do they currently use the products on the market? How would they benefit from your product?
- **Goals:** What goals do they want to achieve when using the product? What problems are they trying to solve?
- **Frustrations:** What issues do they face when trying to use existing products?

# **Example personas**

> "When you make assumptions about your users, you run the risk of being wrong." —Erika Hall, Just Enough Research
> 

Following are three personas that represent the different target audiences for a new cloud-based file-sharing platform that's similar to Google Drive and Microsoft Teams.

You can keep the visual design for personas simple. Don't spend too much time, but consider adding some basic design elements. For example, if you include a stock image to represent your persona, it will feel polished and more realistic. The previous personas were created using Figma. You can use one of the many available templates, or you can make your own.

# **Turning data into a persona**

Every survey is different, but you'll follow a fairly consistent process for analyzing your survey data. Look for patterns. Look for trends. Look for outliers. The answers to those unanswered questions from the very beginning of this project are in your survey results.

Were the client's assumptions correct? Do you now have the data to back them up, or is reality a bit different? Is there some feature that you overlooked? Is there something that you were going to emphasize that you now realize you don't need to worry about?

More importantly, based on the data: Who are your users? What markets should you target?

Do you know the answers? What use cases did you find? Who would use this product, and why?

The use cases that you identify here should form the basis for personas. Ideally, your results will point to a couple of distinct use cases. Individuals may use the same product and the same features, but for different reasons and in different ways. This variety helps you design a flexible product that appeals to a broad range of users.

In a real-world project, it's incredibly important to have a diverse pool of respondents. The larger and more diverse your sample size, the more markets you can identify, target, and personify through personas. You can make an informed decision to cut back and focus on a particular market, but it's best if you have multiple markets to choose from.

# **Pill•bug example**

The UX designer on the project used the survey data and interviews to create the following personas. Review the data, transcripts, and personas to see if you can understand why the designer created the personas in the way that they did.

# **Summary**

A persona, you've learned, is a fictitious user based on a composite of user characteristics. You've also learned that a persona is *not* a real person. You explored what should be included in creating a persona and how it should be made.

# **Experience and idea mapping**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to articulate the importance of experience mapping. You'll learn how to use experience maps to visualize and tell a story based on what you learn about how users interact with a product.*

In this checkpoint, you'll learn how to create three types of experience maps: affinity maps, journey maps, and empathy maps. At the end of this checkpoint, you'll have the option to complete a map for your bus app project.

# **How experience maps are used**

*Experience mapping* is the process of writing out and visualizing steps that users take to accomplish tasks and the things that they experience during these tasks. You can use experience maps to make sure that you are aware of all of the steps that people take before, during, and after they encounter a product.

The main purpose of any experience map is to visualize a story. It helps to use experience maps as visual aids as you talk through the experiences that people have with (and without) products.

Just like in every other industry, terminology can vary in the design world. In this program, you'll see *experience mapping* used as a general term that describes mapping tools like affinity maps and journey maps. Elsewhere, you may see this term used to describe a distinct type of mapping. All of these mapping tools fall under the umbrella of *UX mapping*. Knowing the vernacular will help prepare you for real-world work as a designer.

# **Creating an affinity map**

*Affinity maps*, or *affinity diagrams*, are clusters of related information. Many designers use sticky notes for these clusters because they’re easy to generate quickly and move around in shared spaces, like a whiteboard or wall.

The purpose of affinity mapping is to distill large amounts of data into smaller, more palatable groups based on common themes. You and your team can determine what themes will house the related ideas. You may need to create multiple affinity maps to organize workshop outputs, team discussions, and research findings.

Affinity maps are usually considered tools rather than client deliverables. You should still make your affinity maps look nice, though, in case you need to show them to someone.

# **Creating a journey map**

Journey maps are visuals that show steps users take through a process, such as a shopping experience. They typically show both the physical interactions a user takes, like browsing online, and also the emotions they feel—such as contentment or frustration—along the way.

To create a *journey map*, you can start by defining a set of questions. Your answers will determine the steps in the user journey. Clear and comprehensive journey maps generally include the following components:

- **Persona:** A persona is a data-based archetype that represents a group of people. These people share behavioral patterns, attitudes, motivations, and challenges related to how they use technology, how they spend their time and money, and what is important to them. In a journey map, your persona becomes the actor. When you're creating a user journey, you can use a proto-persona before you are able to gather data to inform your personas. Keep in mind that proto-personas should be temporary solutions. It often helps to create personas that represent your user group as well as your project team. This eliminates the idea that the needs and goals of one group or individual should be considered over another.
- **Timeline:** A timeline in a journey map can start from the moment that a person gets an idea to do a thing. The journey doesn't necessarily start with tapping on a device in hopes of making something happen. Instead, it usually starts when a person realizes that they have a challenge to address. For example, they may run out of laundry detergent, search for a health insurance plan, or call for help with a flat tire. The product-based solution may not come until several steps into the journey.
- **Stages:** The stages (or phases) of the journey will vary based on what happens throughout the journey, and some journeys will have more stages than others. For example, a journey related to e-commerce may have stages like define, research, compare, and purchase. By contrast, a journey that does not involve purchasing anything will have different stages.
- **Touchpoints:** Touchpoints are instances in which users make contact with a product or a representation of a product.
- **Steps:** Steps represent a series of actions that people take in order to achieve a goal.
- **Scenarios:** Scenarios frame the context of a situation in which an actor has a goal to accomplish and has an opportunity to encounter a product.
- **Channels:** Channels are the media through which users encounter products. Channels include anything from noticing a billboard advertising a product, to visiting a website in order to purchase a product.
- **Emotions and feelings:** Emotions and feelings reveal a user's level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction as they go through the steps of a journey.
- **Challenges:** Challenges (also called problems, issues, frustrations, or pain points) are the occurrences that users view as barriers or hindrances to completing a task that they intend to finish.
- **Distractions:** Distractions are minor or major detours within a journey that take the user's attention away from their initial intent. Distractions are often perceived as negative, but they can present potential opportunities. Distractions sometimes give rise to functionalities that are nonessential but are useful or fun.

# **Creating an empathy map**

At this point, you know *what* is going on, and *why* people may be doing what they're doing in a situation. Now you can explore what thoughts are going through their heads, and try to understand what emotions and feelings they experience as they are doing these things. *Empathy maps* reveal what users assign value to.

What a user considers important will vary based on context. For example, someone in a hurry to get somewhere may prioritize speed—but when they're handling their finances, they may care more about accuracy.

You may notice that journey maps sometimes overlap with empathy maps. This is fine; these tools are designed to work together to tell a complete story.

Once you have conducted research with your user groups, answer the following questions to develop your empathy map for current and potential bus users. You can do this individually or with your team.

- **Thinking:** What might a user be thinking at the beginning of their journey? At each step? After they are done interacting with the product?
- **Feeling:** As a user flows through the steps in their journey, how do their emotions fluctuate? What could trigger these emotions? You may consider categorizing emotions as negative, positive, or neutral with respect to how your users define each end of the spectrum.
- **Seeing:** What does the user see in the scenario? Do they encounter advertisements?
- **Hearing:** Are there radio ads or podcasts that introduce people to the product or remind them of it?
- **Saying:** Are users asking questions or sharing their opinions about their experiences? How, when, and where are they talking about the product?
- **Doing:** What have you seen users do in given scenarios? Does what they say match what they actually do?

# **Summary**

Experience mapping is a process that teams can use for articulating, organizing, and visualizing the scenarios in which users encounter products, services, or ecosystems at various touchpoints and channels. Personas take steps to flow through each of the steps that make up the stages defined within a timeline.

The process of building experience maps fosters an environment where teams stay focused on a common goal. In this environment, teams can create and support efficient, effective, and desirable experiences.

# **Extracting and sharing insights**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to extract and prioritize what you learn from your research. You'll also be able to turn your research outputs into an attractive and informative presentation.*

In this checkpoint, you'll learn how to organize and prioritize data gathered during research activities and create a research presentation template.

As a researcher and UXer, your job is far from done when you conduct the last usability test before the product launch. As a responsible practitioner, you'll share what you've learned and contribute to a general body of knowledge.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll have the option of creating research presentation and case study templates that you can use in future work.

# **Share findings**

At the end of each research session, it's a good idea to have a quick chat with the client and any silent observers. The goal is to allow everyone to voice concerns. It's important to make sure that all important points are being documented and shared.

Sharing what you've learned while observing and interacting with users can only improve everyone's experience and lead to several beneficial outcomes:

- The project teams keep user needs and goals on their minds.
- The users feel like companies care.
- The users end up with products and services that solve their problems and meet their needs and desires.
- The businesses continue to improve their offerings.

You will most likely share a comprehensive set of deliverables at the end of your project, representing all the work that you've done. Nevertheless, you should also remember to share important bits throughout the process.

# **Create a report**

Most user research reports are organized into findings and recommendations. *Findings* are your discoveries. They typically include a description of a behavior that you observed plus your understanding of *why* that happened. *Recommendations* are suggestions for what to keep and what to fix in the design based on your research findings.

Let's say, for example, that in a research session you observed a participant struggling to find a button on an interface. Finally, the person finds it and says, "Oh, that blue was hard for me to see; it's so light." Your finding, then, would be that participants struggled to get through the flow (behavior) because the color contrast of the buttons wasn't clear (why). A recommendation could be to use a stronger color with increased contrast.

Provide recommendations in bite-sized pieces that are easy for clients to process. Extract insights, such as what you learned from participants and how it relates to past research. This means going through your notes, recordings, photos, and any other artifacts gathered from your research activities.

You can also keep your findings in a database, to use as contributions to evolving personas and research. Anything you learn about users, at any point in time, can inform your evolving personas.

# **Deliver the report**

Present and discuss your findings with the client. Make sure to address the following topics:

- Main findings, perhaps as a summary
- Behavioral patterns
- Issues
- User feedback
- Plan for tracking recommendations, priorities, and implementation tasks
- Next steps

# **Engage further**

During your career, you may find yourself involved in all types of research projects. Perhaps you'll be part of a team that will continue learning about the same user population over a long period of time. Perhaps you'll conduct a one-off study for a client who you'll only work with once. Or perhaps you'll gather information that will inform a much larger study.

Regardless of the situation, it's a good idea to present your findings and insights in a way that makes your client feel empowered. Even in your absence, they should have enough information to be able to articulate what you did, repeat your study if needed, and continue building upon it in the future.

Suggest methods for ongoing feedback-gathering and evaluation. If needed, you can also suggest additional research activities. If possible, implement these methods and activities yourself.

After you deliver the report, the research may be considered "done." This could be because resources ran out, the scope changed, or something else. In this case, ensure that the client has all the research documentation and important contacts that they need to understand what was done and to continue the research without you.

Alternatively, you may stay involved with the project, site, or application after report delivery. In this case, you should still ensure that the client has all of the research documentation and important contacts.

# **Think forward and share**

Everyone benefits when people share their successes, growth opportunities, mistakes, and moments of enlightenment. Often, the best teachable and learnable moments come from reading, hearing about, or witnessing someone else's experience through case studies. Also, sharing *lessons learned* with the public can create a sense of camaraderie and humanity. Lessons learned remind us designers that even though we have intricate and deliberate processes, and often the best intentions, our needs as UXers evolve as well. There's always more to learn, and there are always new ways to enhance or improve design approaches, ideas, and principles.

Best practices are only the best for as long as they prove themselves to be the best in context. Before motor vehicles existed, traveling best practices may have suggested that one must always ensure that their travel animal was well fed and rested before embarking upon a trip.

# **The case study**

A *case study* is a great way to communicate your knowledge and experience to potential employers. Case studies, which are often featured as part of a UX designer's portfolio, showcase problems that the designer worked on in the past and demonstrate their approach to solving them.

Your case study should explain the problems that you were attempting to solve during this project, the solutions that you created, and the process that you employed to work toward those solutions. Effectively communicating your decisions helps you grow as a professional. It also helps potential clients or employers understand the way you work.

Case studies are a way for you to showcase how you handle the following:

- Discovering and solving problems
- Testing and executing your solutions
- Handling issues and setbacks while working on a project

Designers and developers usually only show the finished project when they present their work. That does little to display the amount of effort it took to create the solution. It completely skips over the various iterations that the project underwent along the way.

A case study requires you to explain everything in more detail. You discuss the decisions that were made, the results from the finished product, and what you could have done differently. The best case studies are messy affairs, where you point out where your assumptions were right, where they were wrong, and how you worked with users to fix your mistakes.

# **Outline**

An effective case study consists of the following components:

- Overview
- Problem statement
- Users and audience
- Role and responsibilities
- Scope and constraints
- Process
- Outcomes and results

# **Overview**

The summary of a case study should be short and to the point. It should define the basics of the project that you worked on. A brief sentence or two will suffice. Focus on the problem or outcome of the project.

Here's an example of a clear and succinct overview:

> There's so much to improve in the banking industry. The user experience is the same as it was 10 years ago. CoreFX wants to change it and give developers the tools to integrate with bank infrastructure. CoreFX needed an identity that matched their core values, and I was delighted to help with design and development.—CoreFX by Julien Renvoye
> 

# **Problem statement**

The problem is what you were hired to solve. The problem statement usually lists the reasons why you were brought on board and outlines the issues that you were given to resolve. Keep this portion brief. There will be ample time to explore the project in far greater depth once you begin discussing your process.

# **Users and audience**

Introduce the key players, including stakeholders as well as users or personas.

# **Role and responsibilities**

Explain your relationship with the project and describe the roles that you played.

# **Scope and constraints**

Mention any constraints, such as budget or timeline.

# **Process**

If your audience reaches the process portion of your case study, then they really want to see *how* you made the decisions that you made. Include all assets created in the design or development process. Your goal is to explain your work and the theory behind it.

This is the perfect place to break out each stage of the design process:

- User research
- Competitive analysis
- User personas
- User stories
- User flows
- Wireframes (with iterations)
- Mockups (with iterations)
- Branding work
- Prototypes (with iterations)
- User testing results

Not all of these items will be included in every case study, but you should include any piece of your project that displays how it changed or advanced while you were working on it.

Testing—and the changes that testing brought about—should receive significant emphasis. Understanding whether or not your solutions worked is essential. Provide information about your testing process and share the results that you discovered from your users.

# **Outcomes and results**

Separately explain your solution to each portion of the problem. Provide reasoning that supports the fixes that you proposed. You should also display screenshots or other images of your presented solutions. Present your solutions and back them up with solid research. If you start by presenting your problem and solution, that allows the people viewing your portfolio to quickly get the gist of what you worked on, without having to wade through your entire process to see the eventual outcome.

*This is an excellent place to include a link to your working project or prototype.* Don't make a potential employer or collaborator hunt through the body of your case study looking for the link.

After sharing your solutions, you should summarize your final thoughts on the project. Ask yourself the following questions:

- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What were your doubts going into the project?
- What surprised you the most?
- What would you have done differently if given more time?
- What did you learn while doing this project?
- How will you use that information in the future?

This list of questions can help you analyze the project's success, the process that you went through to complete it, and what changes you may make to your process for future projects.

Professional designers and design agencies sometimes present case studies in a printed portfolio to clients. While you could do the same, here you'll focus on building case studies that will form the backbone of your online portfolio.

# **Examples of case studies**

- **[Crayola by Daniel Mall](http://danielmall.com/work/crayola/)**
- **[Southern Water by Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/casestudies/southern-water-design-sprint)**
- **[Google+ by Haraldur Thorleifsson](http://haraldurthorleifsson.com/googleplus/)**

# **Summary**

A vital component of user research is sharing the outcomes and findings of your research with the broader team. In this checkpoint, you examined the different ways you can communicate your valuable work to others, including through reports and case studies.

# **Introduction to the define phase**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to explain the purpose of the define phase and use the research information, requirements, and other specifications to create user stories.*

In this checkpoint, you're going to explore the define phase of the design process. In the assignment at the end of this checkpoint, you will use materials from the discover phase of the design process to begin defining your product with user stories.

# **Get started**

You're ready to embark on your next adventure. In this checkpoint, you're going to explore the define phase of the design process. Before you jump in, you'll review a few things that you learned in earlier checkpoints, and you'll contemplate a few additional perspectives.

# **Design thinking: A review**

As you explored in the previous modules, design thinking and UX go hand in hand. Design thinking helps UX designers conceptualize and research during the early part of the UX design process. A clear and concise UX process makes it possible to craft amazing experiences for users.

When you're launching your design career, you may be asked what your design process is and how many steps your process has. The user experience design process is a multistage iterative process that allows designers to continuously evaluate, improve, and polish their designs. Using this process, designers move repeatedly through different stages. In each stage, they assess their designs and ask relevant stakeholders to take part in the process. The goal is to ensure that the product design is efficient and usable. A UX design process typically follows steps that are similar to those in a design thinking approach, which is made up of five core parts:

1. **Empathize with users:** Learn about and seek to understand your audience.
2. **Define the problem:** Identify your users' needs and desires, and articulate the problems they want to solve.
3. **Ideate:** Generate various ideas for the product's design.
4. **Prototype:** Transform ideas into concrete examples and potential designs.
5. **Test:** Evaluate the sample designs.

# **The double diamond: A review**

This program uses the *double-diamond design process* of design thinking. The double-diamond design process has four parts: discover, define, develop, and deliver.

Design is not a linear process. It's iterative. Designers iterate their way forward. The most updated version of the double-diamond model incorporates blue circles that represent the iterative nature of design.

# **Focusing on *UX intensive: Define***

During the *UX intensive: Discover* module, you worked to understand the needs of the users of the bus app you're designing. The information that you gathered through research during that module forms the initial inputs for defining your product. Get ready to put your requirements to use!

In the *UX intensive: Define* module, you'll begin setting the direction for the functionality of the product as well as its look and feel. In this checkpoint, your goal is to define the direction for the bus app through the creation of user stories.

# **Defining the project scope**

To be a great user experience designer, you need to be able to clarify and communicate product scope or boundaries. When you are a working UX designer, you should be prepared to create a *project plan* or *project brief*, which can help you ensure that the project's scope, timeline, and steps are clearly understood by your team and client. As you learned in a previous checkpoint, many modern software teams first work on a minimum viable product (MVP), which is a product with a limited scope. They then increase the product scope over time by designing new features.

In this program, your product scope is determined by the project brief and business requirements for your bus app, as well as your personal time commitment. This can ultimately serve as the core document for your entire design project. Go back and refer to these requirements during each part of the design process, to ensure that your solutions remain within the MVP scope.

Your job is to do the best work you can to meet the MVP. Make it awesome. When you present your work, you can propose additional features that you would like to design and test during future iterations. it is essential that you learn to produce work like a real designer, and practice designing within the predetermined scope. The best designers perfect the skill of being innovative within set boundaries. Like them, you can practice asking, "Does this fall within the scope of what my client wants? How can I create a great MVP that balances client and user priorities?"

### As a UX designer, your job is to craft a design solution that meets the *business requirements set forth by your client.* As you conduct your user research, you may find that users are looking for a specific feature that is outside of the MVP scope. While you can expand the scope if you are in the Immersion program or have the time to dedicate to ensuring it is done well, it is essential that you are able to justify a features' inclusion. Many new designers get feature-happy and want add *all the things*. Don't do this. If you have the time, user research-based justification and bandwidth, you may add a feature that is doable and remains within the MVP scope. This is not the time to add experimental features. In the real world, your client and your boss will not be happy with this kind of derivation. The user stories you create today and the user flows in future checkpoints will help you manage the project scope.

# **Define your bus app**

When you begin a new project, you'll start by collecting business and user requirements, user needs, and other artifacts. During the *UX intensive: Discover* module, you collected a lot of critical information for building a great solution. The work you completed in that module will be extremely important as you move forward; it will help you make sure you're considering what is required for a user to accomplish their task. Putting the user first is essential for designing usable experiences and products. Understanding user needs also helps you create user stories. Simply put, you need to think about what the user needs in order to accomplish their task.

During *UX intensive: Define* module, you'll create deliverables that help you define the following:

- The information architecture, which is the structure of the content and pages
- The screens required for your wireframes
- Your user interaction, visual design, animations, and more

All these assets inform and guide your iterative process. First, you'll map out the activities that the user needs to accomplish their task. Then, you'll go back and update with wireframes as you validate that the path is correct. As you continue working through the project, you'll revisit the user flows and add high-fidelity prototypes.

# **Inputs from *UX intensive: Discover***

Remember all of that hard work you put in to discover and evaluate the user during your work in *UX intensive: Discover*? Now you get to put it to good use.

Here's a review of typical design inputs:

- **Business requirements:** These are provided by the business to document nontechnical requirements. The business requirements are generally collected by a business analyst.
- **Functional requirements:** These are provided by the business or IT to document the technical requirements. The functional requirements are generally collected by a systems analyst.
- **User experience requirements:** These are provided by the business and the user experience team to document specific experience requirements.
- **Branding requirements:** These are typically provided by the client or marketing team. At smaller companies, product and UX/UI designers are sometimes responsible for developing the brand.
- **Personas:** As you learned in the *User personas* checkpoint, the designer typically creates the personas. Research provides statistical data to help you validate your personas and better understand the users who you're designing for.
- **Journey maps:** As you learned in the *Experience and idea mapping* checkpoint, the designer typically creates journey maps.
- **Empathy maps:** As you learned in the *Experience and idea mapping* checkpoint, the designer sometimes creates empathy maps.
- **Marketing requirements:** These are typically provided by the client to document how the product addresses user needs in the market.
- **Service maps:** These are another type of UX map that a designer may create. They act as a counterpart to journey maps, focusing on the actions taken by the service provider rather than the user.

All of these artifacts provide vital information to help you define a product solution that meets the needs of your product consumer.

In this module, you'll focus on synthesizing this information into useful data to define your product solution. You'll take these artifacts and use them to define the user stories, user flow, site map, wireframes, and content experience. Each of these artifacts plays a crucial role in ensuring that you define a product that fulfills the project vision and consumer needs.

# **The bus app project outline**

The *UX intensive: Define* module is the strategic part of this project. Using the research you've gathered, you'll now need to clearly document what your app will do through user stories.

Before creating user stories, review the requirements from the design brief, and review information you've gathered about competitors.

# **Review the brief**

The client's initial brief and business requirements listed several features that they want to see in the app:

> Transit officials have identified a problem that they would like you to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been added recently. Many of those routes stop at the same bus stop.
> 

> For bus riders, simply rushing to the bus stop when they see a bus coming no longer works because the bus that's arriving might not be the bus that they need. Furthermore, running to the bus stop is often hard and inconvenient.
> 

> Riders want to know two pieces of information:What specific bus is arrivingWhen that bus is arriving, so they can calculate how much time they have to reach the bus stop
> 

> Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.
> 

Remember that your task through this module is to design the app from start to finish using all the steps of the design process, from discovery to delivery.

# **Creating user stories**

Your next step is to create user stories. *User stories* are the first attempt that a designer makes to determine what the product needs to be in its purest form. This piece of the design process is of particular value; it determines the order in which you work on things and how long you'll work on them.

Although business requirements are defined long before you begin your research process, it is the user story that connects business concerns with your user research.

User stories are simple and succinct descriptions of a feature that are articulated in a particular format. Specifically, they are told from the perspective of the person who wants or needs the capability that the new feature would offer them. Typically, this person is a user or customer of the product. User stories typically follow a template that involves identifying who the person is, what they want, and why:

> As a [type of user], I want [this goal] so that [this reason].
> 

For example, imagine that you're a new user of a news website with a paywall, and you have a goal of signing up for an account so that you can start reading the news. Your user story would be as follows:

> As a new user, I want to sign up for an account so that I can access the site's content.
> 

# **Who creates user stories?**

Writing user stories is typically assigned to a business analyst or UX researcher. Technical user stories may be handled by a developer. On many small UX or multidisciplinary teams, a UX researcher or UX designer can write them.

In the real world, many UX/UI professionals find themselves working on an **[agile team](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/doing-ux-agile-world/)**. Agile is a software development and project management approach in which teams build products incrementally, focusing on one user story at a time. Agile development and design processes move quickly, and teams that use these processes require tools that allow for efficient and effective collaboration.

User stories are a tool of agile methodology. They allow teams to more easily identify what they're working on, who specifically is working on what, and how that work is being done. And when user stories are applied to the UI design process, they can lay the groundwork that's necessary for each stage of design. It's fairly simple to implement a lean version of user stories into the design process, and the approach can help keep a project on track.

# **Breaking down a user story**

User stories are designed to be short and specific. But because of that, teams need many user stories to identify and capture every possible use case. When you're creating a user story, remember that each individual action needs a corresponding user story task. The more specific a task is, the easier it is for designers and developers to understand and complete the work. To get a story to its most specific and granular level, you and your team will likely need to break it into as many pieces, or tasks, as much as possible.

To see how this works, return to the previous user story example:

> As a new user, I want to sign up for an account so that I can access the site's content.
> 

What does creating a new account entail? Can you break this process down further? The user likely needs to supply several pieces of information: a username, a password, maybe an email address or phone number, and perhaps other relevant information.

So the user story about creating a new account could actually be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks:

> As a new user, I need to create and type in an original username.
> 

> As a new user, I need to create and type in a password.
> 

> As a new user, I need to reenter my password to verify it.
> 

> As a new user, I need to submit this information and create an account.
> 

Ideally, the end result of this process is a long list of user stories with their detailed associated tasks—most of which you'll incorporate into the final product.

As a designer, you'll mentally start piecing together layouts and color schemes when you first start meeting with a project's stakeholders. And as you listen to the stakeholders' goals and learn about their end users, you'll begin to imagine how the app might look. But be careful not to make any design decisions before creating and evaluating what users need and want. By identifying user stories first, you let the users' preferences and potential flows inform and shape the design.

After brainstorming all of the user stories for a product you're designing, you'll add them all to a collaborative document where the client or organizational stakeholders can add any stories that they feel are missing. Once the client and team decide that the team has captured all of the essential aspects of a user's journey through a product, the team will assign a number to each story. The numbers are typically used to measure the story's complexity, which helps the team determine how much time and energy it requires to complete it. These numbers are particularly handy later in the project, when the team will use them as labels to identify which stories are covered in which wireframes.

Here's an example of user stories mapped to wireframes.

This list can do more than remind you about functionality. It serves another important function, as it keeps you connected to the user and aware of them throughout the process. The end user *must* shape and guide your work. And each user story is specifically designed to accommodate your end user, ensuring that you tailor the experience to their needs, preferences, and desires.

# **How personas fit in**

Before you create user stories, review your personas again. Try to put yourself in the shoes of each persona. What kind of features would they want? What matters the most to them? What matters the least? Are there features that they would not use, but another persona might?

When you're generating design ideas, consider the following questions from the perspective of each persona:

- What would they think of this idea, feature, or product?
- How would they react to this idea, feature, or product?
- Would they use this feature or product?
- What would be useful to them?

# **User story prioritization**

When you're creating the user stories needed to build a product in its purest form, you may be tempted to create a minimal list of user stories, right from the start. Some new designers do this because they want to keep the project within scope. But you should know that new projects often generate hundreds of user stories, of which only a few end up built.

Instead of self-editing as you create your user stories, put them all into a spreadsheet. You'll edit this list to conform with the *Pareto principle*. The Pareto principle (also known as the *80-20 rule*) states that users use 20% of the features 80% of the time. Using this principle, you'll be able to prioritize your user stories to focus your efforts on the most needed ones.

This practice of prioritization rather than elimination provides your team with deeper insight into the vision that you have for a project. It also displays your ability to show restraint. Feature creep is a real concern. Your ability to demonstrate control over the scope of a project is an asset.

Here is a sample set of user stories:

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/a47352bdc13a4d11b0c80efa63c2d1e5)

This ranking shows that you have taken time to consider the likely impact of having a solution for the task described. Should a colleague review your user stories, they will be able to tell which tasks you are considering, as well as which tasks you rate as the highest priority.

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/7f35b344a47b42ccb0afb3b75886772d)

In the example above, the perspective has shifted to that of someone who has already signed up for your service. This user has a different perspective and set of priorities than someone who just signed up. As before, the ranking of these tasks plays a key role in determining the priorities for the project.

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/3ebe9deef7f243d2b259a86d9853ecf7)

Now the perspective has shifted to that of an administrator. Accordingly, the tasks have taken on a very different tone. The tasks are focused on the daily needs associated with supporting customers.

Just as you would send out surveys and interview potential users, you should do the same activities with administrators of a service. Interactions with people working in administrator roles are particularly valuable because they know that job better than anyone else.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you learned how to use the research, requirements, and other specifications generated during the discover phase to begin to define a product through user stories.

# **User flows**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to use the research information, requirements, and other specifications to create a user flow for a project.*

# **User flows**

As the design process progresses, things become less abstract and more visual. What previously was a series of profiles of your user (personas) and a prioritized list of features (user stories) will eventually be developed into a visual wireframe. To create an effective wireframe, you need to first isolate and define your *user flows*.

The user flow is the path that a user follows through your interface to complete a task, such as making a reservation, purchasing a product, or subscribing to something.

### New designers often confuse user journeys, user stories, and user flows. A user journey is the 10,000-foot view of the entire user experience. A user story describes one specific requirement. A user flow is somewhere between those two. A user flow focuses solely on the user's interaction with the product (unlike a user journey), and it encompasses the user's entire route through the product (unlike a user story).

# **Why not go straight to wireframes?**

Designers create wireframes to communicate visual hierarchy and elements (like buttons) that help people move from one step to the next. They're the blueprints that you'll follow when designing your mockups.

To design wireframes, you'll first need to know *why* something should be higher or lower in the visual hierarchy. You'll need to know how each item relates to other items on the page. User flows typically provide the answers to the questions that you're going to have when you start laying out your pages.

UX flows are not necessarily linear. They are made up of decision nodes, paths, and loops that show all possible interactions with the product. Usually, flows do not focus on users' feelings or multiple layers of the solution. Their main purpose is to visualize how a user flows and navigates through a product to find their solution.

### Some designers work on low-fidelity wireframes and flows together. They might sketch these out or produce documents called *wireflows*, which are a combination of the two.

# **The user flow diagram**

*User flows*, which are also called *UX flows* or *flowcharts*, are diagrams that display the complete path that a user takes when using a product. The user flow lays out the user's movement through the product. They map out each and every step the user takes—from the entry point right through to the final interaction.

At first, the user flow diagram helps you plan user interaction. It then evolves to include wireframes, visual design, animations, and so much more.

This one document can ultimately serve as the architecture document of your entire design project.

User flows can be complex:

# **User flows versus site maps**

These two types of diagrams often get confused for one another, but they have distinctly different purposes. A site map represents the structure of website pages or software screens. Site maps show destinations, or where users can land. By contrast, a user flow explains how to *get from one destination to another.*

# **User flow attributes**

User flows illustrate the individual steps of a process and help identify what pages will be included in the site map.

Here are the key attributes of a user flow:

- Dynamic, with a directional and variable flow
- Action-based labels
- Focused on process and what the user does

# **Site map attributes**

*Site maps* show the overall hierarchy of an application or website's page structure, as well as the relationship of subsequent pages to one another.

Here are the key attributes of a site map:

- Static
- Location-based labels
- Focused on context and what the user sees

# **The importance of sketching**

As you learned earlier in this program, *sketching* is an important technique at various points in the design process. This is one of those points. Often, your first idea about how a user flow should go isn't the best idea. So iterate. Try solving for a user story by sketching out four different potential flows. This technique, which you'll learn more about later in this module, is called a *four-up sketch* (or *4-up sketch*).

# **User flow sketching example**

*Image source: **[Graham Todman](http://www.grahamtodman.co.uk/blog/category/user-flow/)***

Sketching offers fluidity and flexibility that lets you rearrange the flow more quickly than you could with a digital design tool. Take advantage of this, move sections around, and make different connections between features. Experiment!

Create high-level information architecture for all of the transaction flows within the application. This allows you to streamline the experience as much as possible, and get technical feedback to make sure that what you recommend is possible.

# **Creating user flows**

There are many different pathways that a user can take when interacting with a product. A user flow is a visual representation that is either sketched or created using a design tool. Ideally, you'll take the sketches and lay them out with a design tool. This way, you can continue to update your user flow throughout your project. You'll be able to gradually move toward higher-fidelity versions, until the flow represents the end product.

The user flow diagram begins with the user's entry point, such as an onboarding screen or homepage. It ends with the final outcome, such as a completed purchase, creation of a new account, or execution of a financial transfer. Planning the navigation flow helps you ensure that you've captured the necessary interactions to provide a great user experience.

Open your diagramming tool of choice. This might be Figma, Lucidchart, UXPin, or another tool that suits you best.

# **Step 1: Identify the entry point or starting point**

The *entry point* is the path that a user uses to initially access the site or product. Websites and web apps can have many points of entry, such as searches and ads. But apps generally have a single point of entry, either from the app store or from an installed app on the user's phone, desktop, or kiosk. Understanding the entry point is an important part of the process.

# **Onboarding: An often-forgotten first step**

Don't forget to consider the experience that users encounter when they first create an account. What happens when users access an area that is not yet populated with data? Thinking through these important moments helps you provide a great experience for your consumers. It also demonstrates the expertise that you bring as a user experience designer.

Some of the best products are very much like considerate human beings. They make sure that you are welcomed, that you don't get lost, and that you know how to move through the activity without friction.

# **Step 2: Create a flow outline**

Start creating a draft. Begin by adding boxes to represent steps in user action.

You'll break down your user flow diagram into three main segments: the entry point, the steps to completion, and the final step in completing a task or the final interaction.

# **Step 3: Fill in the steps to completion**

The steps to completion are the primary steps in the flow. They usually consist of the registration, login or onboarding, dashboard, home, and any steps or screens needed to navigate a task to completion. Don't overcomplicate your steps. Minimize friction for your users, and help them complete the tasks quickly and efficiently. Keep in mind that you're still in the draft stage, and your first draft doesn't have to cover every aspect of your application. For example, you don't have to cover error states or blank states at this stage. You can continue to refine this as you evolve your flow.

# **Step 4: Consider the final interaction**

The final interaction represents the last screen that the user sees when they've completed their task. This is the exit from the user flow. Identify what the user sees last. For example, if a user completes a purchase, you could display a "Thank you for your order" screen with the order details. If a user creates an account, the final interaction may complete with access to the user dashboard. When possible, minimize steps and reduce friction in your user flow.

# **Step 5: Define the elements of your user flow**

The early state of a user flow uses shapes to represent steps. As your design evolves and comes to life, you'll replace the simple shapes with wireframes. Later, you'll replace the wireframes with visual designs that represent the interface. Steps are generally represented by rectangles. Entry points, exit points, or connections to other screens are usually represented by circles. If a decision is made, you'll generally represent this with a diamond with lines and arrows that take the user to the next possible action.

To help your users understand what the shapes represent, make sure to add a legend to your diagram.

**Rectangles and squares:** The rectangle is the most common shape used in user flows. Rectangles usually represent a page or UI screen. Rectangles generally do not require action to be taken.

**Lines with arrows:** The lines and arrows depict how users flow between screens and actions.

**Circles:** Circles represent actions and express that a task must be completed or that steps are required. Use circles when you want to represent a task or operation. Circles are almost always labeled with an action, such as "Send order" or "Select item."

**Diamonds:** Diamonds, which represent decision points, are often called *decision diamonds*. Diamonds ask questions, and the possible answers to the question are represented by lines with arrows to help users move through the correct path. For example, you may ask, "User has account?" with yes and no arrows extending from the diamond.

# **Step 6: Refine your user flow**

Once you've created a draft of the user flow, check over your work. Here are a couple of tips for success:

**Make labels meaningful.** So that it's easier for users to read, avoid using all caps. Be specific about what action the user is taking at each step.

**Choose colors wisely.** Use colors to help users identify how elements relate to each other or to highlight important user actions.

# **Step 7: Iterate as needed through the design process**

Creating user flows is a crucial step in the define phase. Spending time understanding your flows, user actions, and decision points help ensure that user interactions are clearly understood.

In most situations, you'll review user flows with your client and team to visually demonstrate how users flow through your product.

Be prepared to update user flow diagrams as you complete wireframes. In many cases, you'll create *wireflows* by adding the associated wireframe to the diagram segment and replacing the box with an app screen or page thumbnail. By the end, you'll have a full map of your product.

# **Summary**

Here's a quick recap of the steps you'll take to design user flows:

- Determine the goal of the user. Ensure that you understand the destination so you can give directions.
- Structure the activities that your users need to perform and the points of interaction.
- Identify what your users need to know and when.
- Sketch out a draft of your user flow.
- Review your user flow, ask for input, and share it with the team.
- To improve your user flow and auditing skills, pay attention to the flow of products that you use every day.
- Make steps and required actions as easy and frictionless as possible.
- Think about your user's journey. Where did they come from? What are they trying to accomplish, and what do they need to know? Did they arrive from a search? What question are they trying to answer?
- After you create the user flows, take a short break from them. Then come back and evaluate the scenarios, thinking through how the user moves through the flows and the links between steps.

# **Assignment**

# **Drafting user flows**

This assignment will be graded by a member of the grading team, so make sure to do the best work possible, carefully reading each piece of the assignment and articulating the design thinking that went into making decisions.

Your user flows should clearly address the core problem of the project brief: Riders want to know *what* specific bus is arriving, and *when* that bus is arriving, so they can *calculate how much time* they have to get to the bus stop.

1. Begin by sketching your user flows by hand to map out all the high-priority user stories that you plan to include in your Bus App.
2. Using a digital tool, refine your high-priority user flows and construct them in a shareable format. Here is a **[user flow kit](https://gumroad.com/l/gRflm)** that you can use with Figma as a starting point.
3. In Google Slides or a presentation tool of your choice (such as Prezi or Canva), create a short 5-minute presentation to present to your client that explains your thinking process and justifies the decisions you made. Remember that you should clearly address the *business requirements* that they set forth in the brief.

# **Content strategy**

After reviewing your user stories and user flows, you know what your app needs to do and the order in which you need to emphasize these features. But what kind of content goes on each page?

This is where *content strategy* and *information architecture* come in. Planning out content needs is sometimes overlooked in app design, but it's one of the most crucial steps in creating user interfaces.

Check out the video below to learn more about information hierarchy:

# 

# **What is content strategy?**

Content strategy, as a domain of experience design, acknowledges the importance of content—both words and images—as design elements with strong business value. It is a broad domain that incorporates UX writing and information architecture, which is the structure and organization of content. The domain also covers the governance of content and editorial workflows that help teams create and manage content for large projects, like informational websites.

Content strategy has been around since the early days of the web. Websites are made up of content, so it makes sense that careful thought and attention should be given to what content is added to the site, where it's added on the site, and how it's displayed. The bigger the site, the more time and money are dedicated to content development and content strategy. Sometimes, entire teams work on content creation and content strategy.

In this program, content strategy is an umbrella term. It encompasses the decisions you'll be making about the structure of the content for the apps you design and the words on each screen.

# **The designer's role**

The realms of content creation and content strategy often overlap with design, but they are all separate disciplines. Unless it's stated from the beginning of a project, the designer shouldn't be expected to create all the content for a project. The designer won't necessarily have the final word on content strategy, either.

But even though you won't be responsible for creating the content as a designer, you can help drive best practices and promote the benefits of content strategy. You can also use real content as you create the wireframes and designs.

In many cases, initial designs represent fully completed best-case scenarios for data population. Although this looks great for wireframes and visual designs, it's important that you use real content. This helps you catch issues with your design assumptions and helps you account for onboarding and error messaging.

*Image source: **[CleverTap](https://clevertap.com/blog/user-onboarding-best-practices/)***

The research and data that you've collected give you an indication of what kind of content should be included. And your user stories and user flows give you an idea of where on the site that content should be. Use that knowledge to suggest headings or subheadings. You don't need to write every line of a paragraph, but you should suggest what the content of those paragraphs should be. You aren't expected to be a copywriter, but you can still empower your clients to recognize the value of content. Work with your clients to provide what you need.

Remember that imagery is content, too. Think about what kind of photos or illustrations could be beneficial, where they could go, and what they should contain. Is there a complex idea that would be better communicated with an infographic? Or is there something that's better said through video?

Earlier in this program, you touched on the concept of site maps. A site map can become an outline for content strategy, allowing you to organize things in a clear way.

# **Site maps**

A *site map* is a diagram that conveys an organizational plan. Site maps are most often associated with websites or apps that have a hierarchical structure. They provide a visual representation of how the product pages or screens are organized and how different sections are linked together. UX designers and information architects use them to define a product's *taxonomy* by grouping related content. Simply put, a site map provides a bird's eye view of a site, all its components, and all its content.

**Note:** Be careful! Site map in this context does not refer to the link at the bottom of a page that shows the list of pages on the website—although, confusingly, this link is also called a site map.

Site maps ensure that elements are located where users expect to find them, and it's a great reference point for wireframes and functional specifications. A site map has several qualities and serves a few important functions:

- It determines how navigation through the site should be structured.
- It identifies where information will be located.
- It defines and informs the relationship among various web pages.
- It provides a structure to guide what pages need to be built.
- It acts as the first real structural deliverable for a UX designer.

So, when should you create your site map? Usually, site maps are created after a UX researcher has developed personas and user journeys. This is after the initial research and discovery stage. You can use a site map as a visual tool to represent what you have learned so far about how your users might navigate the product that you are building.

It can also indicate what you've learned about the information that users need to support them on their journeys to reach their goals. Depending on the type of product and design challenges, designers might work on site maps and flows at the same stage of design—sometimes site maps inform flows, and sometimes flows inform site maps. It can be helpful to keep an open mind and be prepared to iterate on either one as you go deeper into the design process.

# **What does a site map contain?**

A site map is generally a fairly basic diagram. It typically includes one category per page, with a top-level overview at the beginning. Site maps can be helpful and valuable tools as you begin to work with stakeholders. For instance, you can show a client a site map to explain what you're planning to build and get them to understand and support your vision.

**[The UX Review](https://theuxreview.co.uk/sitemaps-the-beginners-guide/)** provides a handy list of the key components of a site map:

- A home page or home screen item at the top
- A reference number for each item in the site map, which helps while creating wireframes or functional specifications
- A label for each item in the site map

# **User flow diagrams versus site maps**

Although user flow diagrams and site maps look similar, they have slightly different visual attributes, and they are used for different purposes.

# **User flow attributes**

User flows show steps in a process. They typically include different shapes, such as rectangles and diamonds, and arrows between steps.

Creating a user flow involves asking a variety of questions about the user's objectives, needs, and interactions. Here are a few examples:

- What is the user trying to accomplish with this product or website? What are their primary and secondary goals? What are their fears or apprehensions?
- How can the user move through the app, website, or service without getting stuck? What can make the transitions between areas and features smooth and seamless?
- What are the features of the product, and which features do users engage with? Which core actions do users perform most frequently? What decisions does a user make before taking an action? How long should each action take to complete?

# **Site map attributes**

Site maps show structure. They typically include rectangles connected with lines and displayed in a hierarchy, like an organizational chart.

Developing a site map involves asking questions, too. Consider these examples:

- How many screens or pages are needed *in total*? (Because a site map should show all possible stages in a user's interaction with a product, you'll need to add up all the possible screens or pages the user could see.)
- How are the app's or product's screens, pages, and groups related to one another? What order or hierarchy do they follow?

The site map is the crucial connection between what the product does (the user flows) and how it's structured (the wireframes).

There are two main research methods that you can use to inform how you structure content categories within your site maps: open and closed card sort studies.

# **What is a card-sorting study?**

As you learned in the previous module, a *card-sorting study* is a user research method that can help you categorize the structure of information for a website or application.

When you conduct a card-sorting study, users classify topics into groups that make sense to them. They may also help you label these groups. These groups often fall into one of the following categories:

- **Nomenclature:** What people call things
- **Connections:** How people classify similar items with respect to proximity or similarity
- **Classifications:** Groups of items and their names

You can use this information to create labels, navigation, and site maps for your design concepts.

# **Open card sort versus closed card sort**

There are two types of card-sorting studies. Each one has different goals.

# **Open card sort**

*Image source: **[Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/demos/)***

You can conduct an open card sort to get a sense of how users connect and categorize information. It's best to use this type of card sort when you want to understand how users of your product would organize your content.

Specifically, the study allows users to group content and identify terms or labels that they would assign to each group or category. After providing the users with the appropriate cards, you'll instruct them to organize the cards into groups that make sense to them. Then, they come up with names for these distinct groups. In the process, users can also rename cards or make suggestions for new cards.

# **Closed card sort**

*Image source: **[Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/demos/)***

A closed card sort is ideal if you want to understand how users sort content items into predefined categories. This practice is valuable when you want to investigate how users would fit content into an existing structure. For example, if you need to add new content to a website, you'll likely want to use a closed card-sorting study.

# **Conducting a card-sorting study**

To conduct a card-sorting study, you can use actual cards or pieces of paper. You can also use one of several online card-sorting software tools, like **[Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/)** or **[Usabilitest](http://www.usabilitest.com/)**.

Before you begin, watch **[this video that shows card sorting in action](http://www.youtube.com/embed/70QziJYQZoI)**.

If you are using a remote testing website like OptimalSort, **[follow the directions for the study](https://support.optimalworkshop.com/en/collections/1524584-optimalsort)**. You can also take **[a sample test on Usabilitest](http://www.usabilitest.com/uxvExDp)**.

# **Summary**

Content strategy refers to the planning for the organization, the kinds of content, and the ways that it is shared with users. Content strategy goes hand in hand with a site map, which is the structural plan for the website or app. Open and closed card-sorting studies are the most common ways to investigate how users think that content should be grouped.

# **Wireframes**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to use the research information, requirements, and other specifications to create wireframes for a project.*

You've already learned what wireframes are, and you know a bit about how to create them. In this checkpoint, you'll apply that knowledge to your project.

# **Wireframes**

You've conducted some user research, defined a few personas so that you can understand your users, and created user flows and site maps to map out your app at a high level. Next step: wireframes.

*Wireframes* are diagrams that visualize the content elements and page hierarchy of the screens or pages in your product. Wireframes are *low-fidelity diagrams*, which means they do not typically incorporate visual styling, such as color and imagery, and they're typically not interactive. Most designers create wireframes using black-and-white sketches and gray-scale line drawings. Wireframes are created by UX designers to plan and define the structure of each page or screen.

# **Wireframes as communication tools**

As a design deliverable, wireframes help ensure that features, scope, and product intention are clearly understood by all stakeholders and team members before anyone starts creating visual assets or writing code. Creating wireframes and using them for planning and team alignment can help you avoid rework and confusion.

Wireframes can help you identify gaps, understand how a user interacts with your interface, and determine layout positioning of graphic elements. They can also help you have important conversations with your team, and they allow you to work at a faster pace than would be possible with high-fidelity layouts.

# **Examples of wireframes**

The wireframe example shown below can give you an idea of how other designers communicate the information hierarchy, calls to action, user interaction, and graphic elements. There are many tools that can be used to create wireframes; the tools you use are determined by your tool preference and any requirements from your team or organization.

Wireframes generally begin as hand-drawn sketches. They're sometimes started during strategy sessions, and other times they are started solo while you decide how to convey the screen intention. You'll likely go through several iterations as you perfect what you're communicating.

Wireframes offer a distinct advantage over high-fidelity design. You can change them quickly and easily, and you can test out early structural and functional ideas without having to make style decisions that could interrupt the flow of creation.

# **Workflows and levels of fidelity**

As a UX designer, you'll probably make many wireframes. You'll likely begin with sketches, and then convert these sketches to digital renderings in a prototyping tool like Figma or a presentation tool like Google Slides. These renderings, perhaps with varying levels of *fidelity*, create the bones for prototypes, which have more detail and are interactive models of your final product.

The type of wireframes you create will largely depend on where you work and what your team's needs are. It's helpful to remember that wireframes are meant to be a communication tool. They help teams understand and align on intentions before any individual starts building digital assets or writing code. Smaller teams might only need a quick wireframe sketch to communicate intention; larger, distributed teams may need very detailed wireframe visuals and specifications.

Here are some examples of workflows you might encounter throughout your career:

- Wireframe > Interactive prototype > Visual design > Code
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > High-fidelity prototype > Code
- Sketch > Prototype > Visual design > Code

For your project, you'll use this structure: Sketch > Wireframe > Prototype.

# **How to create wireframes**

In this part of the program, you'll use a typical process that incorporates both sketching and the creation of digital wireframes.

# **Step 1: Review your research and requirements**

As a first step, take some time to look over all of the information and diagrams you've created so far.

First, take a look at your design brief, the competitive analysis, and the documentation you've already created. The questions that occur while creating wireframes are often answered by looking back at the work you've already done. What do you need to include in your wireframes? Look at your user stories. In what order should they be laid out? Examine how you prioritized your user stories. How should features, buttons, and content be organized? The user flows and content strategy can help you answer those questions.

Next, look into similar products, UX trends, and—when available—internal design guidelines to make sure that you are covering all of the bases. If you are creating something completely new, look outside your realm. Take a look at other business domains and patterns, and evaluate how other products handle various scenarios.

As you're creating your wireframes, it's important to think about the viewport that you are designing for. Are you creating a mobile app, web app, mobile-first app, or responsive app? Knowing the general screen size helps you focus on designing elements and patterns that work for that context.

# **Step 2: Sketch**

Before you get deep into designing detailed visuals or mockups—a process that's also called *pushing pixels* in the design world—you should begin with sketching. You don't have to be a great artist to sketch, but *sketching* is a critical skill for a UX designer.

Sketching isn't about perfection. It's a powerful tool used throughout the design process to seek and find solutions to problems. Sketching should be minimalistic and communicate ideas clearly. You'll only need to draw simple shapes.

Quote: **[Why We Sketch](https://articles.uie.com/why_sketching/)**

# **Why sketch?**

Most designers start with sketching rather than diving directly into using design software. There are many reasons for this:

- The basic tools used in sketching allow you to explore ideas quickly and more efficiently.
- Saving time saves money.
- Speed lets you consider the problem from different angles through the rapid iteration of an idea.
- You can often remove creative blocks.
- You can gain approval from stakeholders earlier in the process by presenting your sketches for review.
- The ability to communicate your ideas through a sketch is a highly desired skill that's sought after by companies large and small.

# **Tools for sketching**

A basic setup for sketching can consist of just an 8.5"x11" piece of paper and a pen. You could also use some of the following common tools:

- Sharpie
- Thick gray marker
- Set of markers, such as Faber-Castell markers, for color work
- Paper
- Templates of browser or mobile screens from a source like **[Sneakpeekit](http://sneakpeekit.com/)**
- Whiteboard with dry-erase markers

# **Sketching with shapes**

Interfaces in mobile and web applications can be simplified to their basic shapes, such as rectangles, squares, circles, and triangles. If you can draw simple shapes, you can sketch. These simple shapes can be translated into the following components:

- **Rectangles:** Sections, modal windows, buttons
- **Squares:** Sections, avatars, modal windows, buttons, photos
- **Circles:** Avatars, photos, lists
- **Triangles:** Avatars, photos, icons
- **Lines:** Dividers, section borders

# **Sketching your ideas using the crazy eights or four-up technique**

Two popular sketching techniques are known as *crazy eights* and *four-ups*. These are rapid ideation activities that help designers explore a variety of concepts quickly. In these activities, designers fold a piece of paper into either eight or four segments. Then, within a short time interval such as five minutes, they sketch a different concept in each segment of the paper. The time constraint and number of ideas (either eight or four) help people use divergent thinking to generate a variety of concepts.

# **Step 3: Review your work**

Once you have a few layouts that seem to work, refer back to your user stories, personas, user flows, and content strategy. Start to match things up. How does the layout match with each of these? Have you included all of the highly ranked aspects of your research? Do you need to make a few adjustments to the layout? What do your stakeholders think?

If you need to make any changes after asking these questions, do it now. Once you have identified one or a few of the best layout options, you can proceed to making digital versions of your wireframes.s

# **Step 4: Create digital wireframes**

After you sketch or whiteboard your initial wireframes, you'll then create them in digital form so that you can update the user flows along with the wireframes.

# **Tools to create wireframes**

There are many tools to create excellent wireframes. Most professional teams use prototyping tools like Figma, visual design tools like Sketch, or presentation tools like Google Slides. Figma offers these **[handy the Wireframe Kits](https://www.figma.com/resources/assets/wireframe-component-library/)** that are a great place to start for this program.

Image: **[Robert Smith](https://medium.com/@robertsmith_co/validating-your-product-design-ideas-with-low-fidelity-wireframes-fba03b84af23)**

# **Wireframe best practices**

Below are a few guidelines to keep in mind as you start creating digital wireframes.

1. Start by determining which viewport you are creating for. If you are designing for mobile, you'll want to represent a mobile-sized screen and use mobile components as you create your wireframes. If you are creating a desktop application, you'll use a larger screen and desktop-friendly components. Draw out the relative screen frame.
2. Design the components and functions of the screen while referencing user stories, requirements, and your sketches.
3. Avoid unnecessary detail. Use gray-scale elements and simple shapes. While you might want to use a color for links or buttons, avoid spending time on using full color at this stage.
4. Make your wireframes as clear and consistent as possible. Wireframes help you visualize the layout of your screens. Leverage usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on.
5. Once you've created a few variations, get feedback and collaborate. Don't do your work in a vacuum. The more information and collaboration you have, the better your end result will be.
6. Practice nonattachment. Be willing to change and adapt often.

# **Digital wireframing with Figma**

In this program, you'll create digital wireframes in Figma. Watch the video for a full tutorial on creating wireframes with this popular tool, then open up this **[link for the Wireframe Kits](https://www.figma.com/resources/assets/wireframe-component-library/)**.

# 

# **Summary**

You learned about the critical importance of sketching before going digital. You also learned how to turn your sketches into simple, low-fidelity digital wireframes that can be used for early testing.

# **Assignment**

Follow these instructions to complete this assignment:

1. Review and refine your site map from the previous checkpoint. Include a link in your Design Journal, making sure to specify the version and note that it is a refined iteration, so the graders can review it while they grade your wireframes.
2. Start by sketching your wireframes by hand. Include a sketch of every page that you think will be necessary for your bus app.
3. Now, using Figma, draft digital versions of your wireframes for your bus app using **[these Wireframe Kits](https://www.figma.com/resources/assets/wireframe-component-library/)**.

**Tip**: If you are having trouble, watch the preceding video a few times and take notes.

**[Robert Smith](https://medium.com/@robertsmith_co/validating-your-product-design-ideas-with-low-fidelity-wireframes-fba03b84af23)**

When you are finished, upload images of your sketches to your Notion Design Journal and Figma, and share a link to them along with a link to your digital Figma wireframes.

### Make sure you update your settings and security permissions in Notion to allow your graders access to your workspace.

When you are finished, share a link to your work.

Here are some examples of sketches and digital renderings:

# **Clickable prototypes**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to use the research information, requirements, and other specifications to define a clickable prototype.*

In the last checkpoint, you created wireframes. Now, you'll bring them to life with a prototype. Prototypes can be low fidelity or high fidelity. Low-fidelity prototypes include only the base structure from the wireframes, without the colors, styles, and fonts that you'll use for the visual design. Ultimately, you'll create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity clickable prototypes, but you'll start with a low-fidelity version for initial usability testing.

At this stage of the design process, you want to be able to test the features that you've created so that you can get feedback on your decisions. Prototyping tools let you create a clickable prototype for users to test and provide feedback on—without requiring you to develop a complete product.

# **Key terms**

- Clickable prototype

# **Using prototypes early in the design process**

Creating a *clickable prototype* early in the process lets you catch usability issues or areas where your flow may not make sense. Another benefit of prototyping is that it serves as a sanity check for you, the designer.

When you're building out wireframes, it can be easy to skip over steps in a complex user flow. Otherwise, you may not think through what's behind a particular button or link. Prototyping doesn't give you that same luxury. You need to connect each stage in the app, each step in a process, and each part of every user flow. Any gaps or missing pieces become obvious right away.

Now, this doesn't mean that you can't take any shortcuts when you're building out a prototype. You certainly can. When you're building out an app like this, the process of adding, editing, and organizing items can be simplified and abbreviated in some ways. You are not expected to offer the full capabilities that your app will actually have. This is a prototype, after all; it's not a finished product.

A word of warning, though—avoid shortcuts that could hide UX design flaws. If a feature is really important, or if it's the focus of a lot of internal discussion and debate, then put in the time to build it out. It's better to spend the time now so that you can move forward knowing that you have a functional design to test. Otherwise, you risk discovering later on that the assumptions that you made were wrong.

# **How to create a clickable prototype**

There are many tools that you can use to create prototypes. This program has asked you to use Figma as your primary tool because Figma is an industry standard and an important technology to be familiar with. But feel free to explore other popular tools, such as InVision, Balsamiq, Sketch, UXPin, Justinmind, and Proto.io.

1. Open Figma, InVision, or the prototype tool of choice.
2. Open your wireframe files. Depending on the software that you use, you may have to convert your wireframes to image files first.
3. Organize the user flow to make the sequence of activities.
4. Add hotspots representing the links or clicks.
5. Add simple animations or interactions as needed.
6. Click **Run** or **Play** to interact with your prototype.

Watch the video for a tutorial on creating a low-fidelity prototype in InVision below or **[watch this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg)** on prototyping in Figma.

# 

# **Review and iterate**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to refine your prototype so that it incorporates stakeholder and user feedback.*

Once you've created your wireframes and prototype, you can use them to test your assumptions and ensure that users understand how to interact with your system. In this checkpoint, you'll take some time to incorporate the feedback you've already received on your designs. You also have the option of conducting a usability test on your bus app.

# **The importance of iteration**

By this stage of the course, you've created flows and wireframes, and you've turned those ideas into a *clickable prototype*. You have also received feedback on your designs from instructors, mentors, and possibly other classmates.

Take some time to review the feedback you've received. What was working? What wasn't working well?

One of the skills you'll develop as a designer is the ability to throw out ideas that aren't working for your users—perhaps because they aren't clear or structured in a way that makes sense to your audience. Start developing your ability to iterate by using this checkpoint to make changes to your prototype.

# **Early-stage usability testing**

In addition to implementing feedback from your instructor and peers, you can also conduct a *usability test*.

Although running a usability test at this stage is an optional requirement for this course, it's important to know that most designers conduct at least informal usability testing after they complete a prototype.

# **Benefits of usability tests**

Consider the following passages from the book **[Don't Make Me Think, Revisited](http://sensible.com/dmmt.html)**, which was written by usability expert Steve Krug.

Usability testing allows you to watch and listen to how people interact with the designs you create. Users don't always think the way that you do, know the things that you know, or use products like you do.

# **Qualitative versus quantitative usability tests**

Informal usability tests, which are also called *guerrilla usability tests*, are used as a qualitative measure to identify and fix problems. The goal of these tests is to see how people actually use the product. This shows you whether your designs are as effective as you expect them to be, or whether there are areas that you need to adjust or redesign.

Qualitative usability tests are a great option for early-stage design because they don't require large groups of people to generate usable feedback. A few users are enough to determine pain points and guide your revisions.

Quantitative usability testing takes a current design and tests it against a newer one. For quantitative tests, you typically need a large number of participants in order to draw conclusive results.

The goal is to determine if the new design provides more clarity. This is done by measuring the user success rate at completing certain tasks, and measuring the amount of time taken to complete those tasks. For example, if you find that users aren't completing the onboarding process, you could use quantitative testing to test a redesigned onboarding process against the current implementation. This way, you could see if there's an improvement in the number of completions. If there is an improvement, then you know that it's worth building out the new design.

# **Conducting usability tests**

Qualitative usability tests can be conducted in person or remotely.

# **In-person testing**

Watching users test your designs right in front of you provides the best results. You can write a script or outline a series of tasks for them to complete, and then observe their facial expressions and body language as they use your designs. Try to answer the following questions:

- Do they seem puzzled by your navigation?
- Are they squinting to read your button labels?
- Do they seem confused by your choices?

The user may not say these things out loud. The value of user testing is in watching them make choices and asking for clarification if needed.

# **Remote testing**

*Image source*: **[User Testing](https://courses.thinkful.com/www.usertesting.com)**

Because of time and budget constraints, in-person testing isn't always an option. In that case, you can conduct remote usability tests. Remote usability testing allows you to test interfaces without being in the same room as the user. This type of testing is typically conducted via videoconferencing software, lasts 15-30 minutes, and tests 3-5 tasks.

Remote tests can follow the same general approach as in-person tests. You'll write a script and outline a series of tasks for the participant to complete. The main difference is that instead of having them physically in front of you, you'll need to be on a video call using screen-sharing.

# **Testing your bus app**

To get practice with the process as well as valuable feedback on your bus app, you can conduct a remote usability test as an option in this part of the program.

When the test begins, be sure to walk the tester through the process for sharing their screen. This way, you'll be able to see how they make their way through your project. Although you won't see their facial expressions and body language, you'll still get to watch the user attempt the task.

Once you've completed your usability test, you can create an observation report. The observation report represents the survey results, as well as observed participant behaviors, so that you can update your wireframes to reflect user needs.

# **Introduction to the develop phase**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to describe the overall work to be done in the develop phase. You will also be able to identify strong designs for inspiration.*

# **Get started**

In this checkpoint, you're going to explore the develop phase of the design process. In this program, the develop phase is focused on the visual design of the product you're creating. You'll take your early app ideas and continue to develop them with greater detail.

Nondesigners typically assume that visual styling is all that your work entails. The previous checkpoints should have firmly established that this perception is not accurate; there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done before you can confidently design high-fidelity versions of your product. You're going to use that work now to make the experience of creating high-fidelity visuals smooth and efficient.

Before you jump in, you can review a few ideas that you learned in earlier checkpoints.

# **Principles of good design: A review**

As you learned in *UX fundamentals*, there is a science behind good visual design. Certain principles and practices ensure that a design is visually appealing. These principles work together to create a design that has an aesthetic and emotional impact. Effective designers create impact by using a grid, using design treatments sparingly and appropriately, and applying the psychology of color. They also plan when, how, and where to use animation or specific interactions.

Before you embark on this step of the process, refresh your knowledge of pattern libraries from the *Fundamentals: Visual design* module. Using pattern libraries can help a UI designer quickly elevate the quality of their visual design work.

It can also help to take a look at design inspiration before you begin. This puts you in a creative mood and reinforces best practices, helping spark ideas as you begin pushing pixels. Create a folder of designs that you like. Pay attention to any interactions with products and their interfaces that feel impactful, pleasurable, and aesthetically pleasing.

# **Focusing on the develop phase**

During the discover phase, you worked on researching your audience and understanding your client's needs through the brief. During the define part, you created foundational documents, like flows and wireframes, to set the stage for how the app will work. In *UX intensive: Develop*, you'll practice being a UI designer by bringing more detail and visual styling to your screens.

# **Energizing your wireframes and prototypes**

UI designers often do the work of translating low-fidelity wireframes into polished visual design systems, pattern libraries, and development-ready digital design assets. Much of their day-to-day work involves creating higher-fidelity prototypes and *design mockups*, which are documents that provide visual design specifications to developers.

As you've discovered, wireframes and prototypes are created and modified fairly quickly. This makes feedback, iterations, and testing easier as well. The low-fidelity format helps you be nimble and work quickly; wireframes are quick to build and easy to modify significantly. Prototypes take a bit longer because they include content and a little bit of style. Mockups are the highest-fidelity formats; they are detailed and time-consuming, which is why they are produced after earlier decisions are made.

When creating a mockup, you're specifying the visual details. Exactly how large should headlines be? How should you style these buttons? What sort of background images, patterns, or colors should you use?

These are all things that are ignored in the wireframes and mostly left out of your early, rough prototypes. You were busy answering the bigger questions: How should this page be laid out? What's the overall hierarchy of the page? Are the calls to action prominent and positioned right? Now that these questions are already answered, your high-fidelity visuals will focus on the details. You'll reinforce the choices that you made in the wireframes and prototypes.

There are vital steps to ensure that you create a design that meets requirements. In this module, you'll learn about branding, design systems, and mood boards to answer questions and make design decisions about visual style. Your goal for this module to add some of these stylistic enhancements to your bus app prototype. As an option, you can also create formal mockups of your work.

# **Branding and design systems**

Developing a *high-fidelity prototype* or mockup involves creating and applying *branding* and *design system* requirements to wireframes. This module takes you through the full process. Nearly all of the questions that you'll raise during the visual design phase can be answered by the wireframe, branding, and design system that you create.

*Image source*: **[The Logo Smith](https://imjustcreative.com/nasa-brand-identity-guidlines-circa-1976/2019/07/02)**

Notice the value of following the design process in this general order. If you had tried to jump from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups, you would be left with unanswered questions. How would you choose your typefaces or color scheme? Your choices may not have reflected the values of the brand—or worse, they may have actively conflicted with the branding. This can lead to unnecessary rework.

# **Mood boards and style tiles**

In this module, you'll create a simple style guide and a *mood board* to guide the overall look and feel of the product.

When you are ready to design your app in high fidelity, you'll go back and review these inputs. You'll get a sense for the kinds of feelings that you want the finished design to convey, and you'll explore the different visual elements and effects that you can add to the page. Play around. Experiment. See what looks good, and what doesn't.

# **Details matter: Designers pay attention**

When it comes to UI design, attention to detail is crucial. Sometimes, a small and subtle change can make an impactful difference. The challenge is to begin paying attention to every single aspect of your designs. Attention to detail is a valuable skill that helps designers stand out.

You need to be able to differentiate good design from bad design. Train your eye and try to work on improving your eye for design every day. Consciously take a look around you—there are instances of good and bad design everywhere. Focus on honing your skills by creating a daily habit of visiting the top design sites, such as Dribbble and Behance. Study the top designers and notice how they use whitespace, typography, spacing, and color combinations.

Practice really does make perfect.

Here are some excellent websites for inspiration:

- **[Behance](https://www.behance.net/)**: Top online portfolios with the latest work from creative professionals across industries
- **[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/)**: A community of designers sharing their work
- **[UpLabs](https://www.uplabs.com/)**: A curated dashboard that displays the best of design and development inspiration
- **[Awwwards](http://awwwards.com/)**: An awards website that promotes design talent
- **[UI Movement](http://uimovement.com/)**: The best UI design inspiration, every day

And here are some great design-related websites to inspire you and help you grow:

- **[Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com/)**
- **[Designmodo](https://designmodo.com/)**
- **[Speckyboy Design Magazine](https://speckyboy.com/)**
- **[Medium Design](https://medium.com/design)**
- **[Web Designer News](https://webdesignernews.com/)**
- **[Design and UX on SitePoint](https://sitepoint.com/design-ux)**

Learning the basics of animation and interaction design is another great way to stand out as a UI designer who creates excellent and engaging designs. Just like the subtle details that make designs great, animation can make a huge difference and create an impactful user experience.

As you evolve as a UI/UX designer, hone your interaction design and animation skills through practice. Learn about the intentional usage of motion, starting with the foundations of animation. Try to understand when, how, and why to use animation. Learn about keyframes, transitions, easing, and speed. Explore how animation can create delight for users when used appropriately.

To learn more about motion, check out Google Material Design's **[Making Motion Meaningful](https://design.google/library/making-motion-meaningful/)** and **[Material Design Motion](https://youtu.be/cQzien5H2Do?list=PLJ21zHI2TNh-rX-Xr_xi9KIEcbdee_1Ah)**.

# **Summary**

Throughout this phase of the design process, you'll refine the details of your UI design. You'll create and apply branding guidelines to turn your low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity visuals.

Remember, you don't have to invent everything from scratch. Great designers pay attention to other good designs in order to borrow, remix, and adapt.

Are you unsure how to style your buttons? Look for effective and interesting button designs and patterns.

Can't quite seem to nail a compelling look for a particular combination of text, icons, and images? Again, look for effective and interesting examples of work that others have done. You can explore options by searching for design trends, award-winning designs, and patterns that solve similar challenges. Almost every scenario that you encounter has a recommended solution that can inform your design.

If you need to find a great way to convey an error message, look around and do some competitive research. For example, you could take inspiration from the example below.

# **Design systems**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to argue for the importance of a design system and describe some popular design systems.*

In this checkpoint, you will explore design systems and the methodologies used to create them.

# **Design systems**

*Design systems* are collections of rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in design and code. These three attributes serve distinct functions and provide coherent, systemic order in systems ranging from buttons to single-page apps.

Design systems and repositories can also contain the styles and components that represent a design for a particular company or suite of products. Creating and consistently applying a single design system can reduce a team's rework and recreation efforts, ultimately saving a company money.

# **Atomic design**

*Image source*: **[Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)**

*Atomic design*, which you learned about earlier in this program, is a methodology for creating design systems. Atomic design has five specific and distinct levels:

1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Templates
5. Pages

As you create your own visual designs throughout this module, consider designing an atomic system to promote consistency across your product.

# **Design system examples**

To get familiar with design systems, and to start gathering ideas for your bus app project, check out these examples.

# **Google's Material Design**

Google created **[Material Design](https://material.io/design/)**, which is a design system that you learned about in the *Fundamentals: Visual design* module. Material Design is a versatile and adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools built to support user interface design tasks. It's backed by open-source code, promotes best practices in UI, and streamlines collaboration between designers and developers. If you're designing apps for Android systems, you'll likely use Material.

# **Apple**

**[Apple's design system](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/)** informs the design of Apple's apps and suite of products. This iconic design system can provide designers with tons of inspiration, information, and guidance. You can download the San Francisco, or SF, symbols, which complement the system font used in Apple's devices. The style guide also provides guidelines and instructions for UX design and accessibility. If you create iOS apps, you'll need to adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

# **Airbnb**

Airbnb shares a comprehensive overview of its **[design system](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)** through a series of articles that explain the company's design decisions and direction. The articles also provide examples of each design's practical application and share lessons learned. The core characteristic of Airbnb's design language is that individual components can exist on their own as distinct entities, and continue to evolve as such, while also remaining part of a larger cohesive design system. You can compare this design system to a living, breathing organism.

# **Lightning Design System**

Developed by Salesforce, the **[Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)** supports and promotes visual unity and easy access for anyone designing for the Salesforce platform. The design system emphasizes and focuses on application logic, user experience, interactions, and flows. It provides in-depth guidelines and examples that cover not only design guidelines but also accessibility issues and component blueprints.

# **Maintain consistency**

As a new designer, you might assume that you need to reexamine your choices and try something new and different for each stage of design. In fact, the opposite is true.

Visual experimentation is important and encouraged. But once you choose a style, maintain it across your high-fidelity deliverables. If you find that the style that you've established does not work consistently across your project, make whatever adjustments are needed. Then go back and tweak every instance of that same element.

When possible, create styles that help you quickly adapt if necessary. If you change a heading style, creating a style pattern allows you to update universally. There are plenty of opportunities to be creative and inventive as you bring your design to life—just make sure to apply discipline to your design.

Beginning designers often overstyle their designs. Resist the temptation; instead, focus on consistency. Consistency across a design makes for a good user experience. This is because consistency educates your user and helps them form a mental model of what to expect as they move through the flow. Users come to understand what a button looks like, what a link looks like, and how to effectively read a page and interpret what each element is or does—all because of this consistency.

What's more, developers expect this consistency when you give them your specifications to code. Code is unforgiving, and small inconsistencies in your mockup can lead to a tremendous amount of extra work for the developer if they have to build out those small differences in code. Even if it's more time-consuming for you, it's much better and more professional to maintain consistency throughout your design.

# **UI design tools for visual design**

There are many visual design tools that you can use to create high-fidelity designs. In your career, the tool that you decide to use may be determined based on your preference, or it may be determined by the team you join or the project requirements. (You'll learn more about working with teams in a later module.) Understanding more than one tool helps you become a well-rounded designer, and it can aid you in producing assets that you can hand off smoothly without rework or stress.

First, get familiar with the popular design tools that are described below.

# **Adobe Creative Suite**

Adobe Creative Cloud is the industry standard for design professionals—the range and depth in its suite of tools are unrivaled. It includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, and much more. If you're looking to be truly multidisciplinary and regularly share a workflow with other designers, Adobe Creative Suite is a good choice.

# **Adobe XD and Sketch**

Adobe XD and Sketch are very similar tools, but each has distinct strengths. Adobe XD has a slight edge due to some recent features such as auto-animate and auto-grid, but Sketch is known for its customizable toolbar and large library of plugins. Both are excellent tools for UI design, and they are worth exploring to see how they fit in your design pipeline. Check out this **[in-depth, side-by-side comparison](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/adobe-xd-vs-sketch-2019)** of Adobe XD and Sketch to get a better sense of the specific features and functions that each tool offers.

# **Adobe XD**

Adobe XD's repeat-grid feature allows you to replicate an element and create a grid of linked elements that all use the same structure. Because the elements are linked, any formatting changes that you make to one element are replicated across the whole grid. This feature can save you a lot of time if you're designing a page with repeating elements.

Adobe XD has other powerful features, including the following:

- Interactive prototyping
- Responsive resize, which makes it easy to optimize designs for multiple screen sizes
- Multipage design options

*Image source*: **[Adobe XD Design](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)**

# **Sketch**

Sketch 3 has a set of nested symbols that help create your best work. You can combine the symbols to create reusable, flexible designs with ease. There are several features that are extremely useful for designers, including the following:

- Artboards
- Text and shared styles
- Color picker
- Pixel perfection

*Image source*: **[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)**

# **Figma**

In this program, you'll continue to use Figma. Figma is a web-based design tool that allows for real-time collaboration. The fact that Figma works in web browsers is important. This is why:

- There's no software that you need to download, install, and continually update.
- You don't need to save and organize your files. Your work automatically saves to a shared space in the cloud.
- Everyone can see and access your work with a single URL.
- You don't need to continually upload, sync, and arrange PNG files in multiple places.

*Image source*: **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**

# **Keep exploring**

When it comes to learning software as a UX/UI designer, keep looking to the horizon. There are many design tools that continuously evolve to support the evolving needs of designers and developers. After you master one tool, it's often easy to learn new ones, so we encourage you to be ready and willing to adapt.

# **Best practices and mental models**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to define mental models and describe best practices for visual design.*

There are some elements that make it possible to ensure that your design is great. If you make sure that you do not break the *mental models* that users are accustomed to, this helps users quickly learn to use and feel comfortable with your application.

# **Mental models**

A *mental model*, or schema, is a person's internal idea about how something works. Mental models relate to how a person perceives the world around them, what they've learned through training or past experience, and what they believe to be true.

The concept of mental models comes from Scottish psychologist Kenneth Craik's book **[The Nature of Explanation](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Nature_of_Explanation.html?id=wT04AAAAIAAJ)**. He determined that the human mind creates "small-scale models of reality" to understand events and the world around them.

Mental models play an important role in UX design, human-computer interaction (HCI), and interaction design. Designers are responsible for supporting people's existing mental models of how interface elements should work. When designs support a population's existing mental models, the website or app seems much easier to use.

Now, take a look at an example. Look at the door below. To open it, should you push or pull?

What about this one—push or pull?

Most people will say pull for the first example and push for the second. This is because, over time and with experience, our mental models have been built up to reinforce the idea that handles indicate pull and bars indicate push.

Have you ever encountered a door with handles like the first example and pulled a couple of times—only to realize that the door is meant to be pushed? This is an instance of a design breaking your mental model of how it should work. Although the annoyance of that interaction might seem minimal, it is the designer's responsibility to make a user's interactions as seamless as possible.

Additionally, you should not allow your desire to make things unique or artistic lead you to go against common mental models about website and app interfaces. Often, it is better to stick to expectations and differentiate your product in other ways.

# **Best practices for designing an interface**

Start by understanding your users' goals, mental models, preferences, and tendencies. Make sure that you have a sense of who your users are and how they navigate the world. Then, consider the following best practices when you're designing an interface, and consider *human-computer interaction*. The goal is to generate *positive affect* for users, or the experience of delight or fulfillment.

# **Promote clarity**

Use large, colorful, and engaging interfaces with intuitive controls and clear mappings between hardware controls. Make sure that the text is easy to read and easier to understand.

*Image source*: **[Headspace App Information Architecture study](https://medium.com/@phaneron/headspace-app-information-architecture-457ef0a3cc16)**

Here are some tips for promoting clarity:

- Use typography to create hierarchy, structure, and consistency. Remember that different sizes, fonts, and arrangements of your text aid in readability. You'll review layout, typography, and color choices in more depth in the following checkpoints.
- Use a systematic approach for labeling elements.
- Create a systematic page layout, and then consider the spatial relationships between items on the page and the structure behind them. Place items in intentional and clean spaces, which draws attention to the information that the user needs to achieve their goals.

# **Minimize options**

Less is more. Data overload and option abundance cause consumers to seek aggregated, streamlined, and value-added experiences to maintain clarity and focus.

Here are some tips for keeping things clean and spare:

- Focus on the primary goal of each page or product, and make it clear what you want the user to do. Include clear calls to action and visual feedback. Promote simple and sensible way-finding.
- Keep the user's desired transaction in mind at all times. Make sure to prioritize utility.

# **Consider simplexity**

Although aesthetics and the wow factor continue to guide UI design, a key benchmark for good design is the ability for both young and old people to easily interact with it. Sometimes called a grandma test, considering *simplexity* can help you make design decisions that work for people with varying levels of technological expertise. When you design a website, try to make sure that you could show it to anyone—no matter how familiar they are with technology—and they would quickly understand what the website offers and how to interact with it.

Use these tips to achieve simplexity:

- Use large buttons that can accommodate large fingers.
- Include *microcopy*, which are the small pieces of text that help users understand an interface. This can include text like error messages and hint text.
- Integrate help that is contextual and easy to discover, but never forced on the user.

# **Design for emotion**

Try to create interactions that engage people both intellectually and emotionally. Reduce possible frustration or annoyance. If the interactions are interesting or make people feel empowered, the designs will more than merely function—they will engage!

*Image source*: **[Monyay Project](https://bringjoy.ideo.com/)**

Here are several tips to help you evoke positive emotions and inspire your users:

- Determine a strategy for your colors and textures. You want your site to be harmonious and pleasurable to use for your target demographic.
- Consider *edge cases*, which are the unusual uses that may arise.
- Anticipate errors. Users will do things outside of your planned flow. Understanding the real data that goes into the system is key to identifying potential edge cases that can cause frustration.
- Pretend that the product is human. Software should act like a considerate human being.

As noted in previous checkpoints, make sure that you pay close attention to the great design all around you. Observation and daydreaming make you a better designer.

# **Don Norman's design principles**

*Image source*: **[Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-design-of-everyday-things/id1209990641)**

In his influential book **[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654)**, designer Don Norman outlines six principles for interaction design: affordance, visibility, feedback, mapping, constraint, and consistency. These principles are also useful to keep in mind during your design process.

# **Affordance**

*Affordances* are cues that communicate to users how they can interact with a system. They help users answer the question, "How do I use it?" For example, visible scroll bars suggest that users can scroll down a page, door handles indicate that users should pull to open the door, and volume sliders invite the users to adjust audio volume.

# **Visibility**

*Visibility* is the idea that users are more likely to know about elements when they are visible—and to be unaware of elements that they don't see. In your designs, make sure that the most relevant elements are immediately visible. These elements can also be highlighted using differentiated visual treatment and central placement. Just by looking, the user should be able to understand the range of available actions.

# **Feedback**

*Feedback* helps users answer the question, "What is happening right now?" Designs should give immediate feedback to the users about the results of their actions and the state of the system, so that the user knows exactly what they have done and what the result is. For example, when a light is turned off, the position of the switch and the text on it communicate that the light is off. A website could give feedback by indicating where a user is in a process and giving a clear indicator when they move to the next step.

# **Mapping**

*Mapping* refers to the relationship between controls and their effects. Mapping helps users answer the question, "What does this control do?" Designs should use natural, intuitive mappings to help users easily understand the relationship between actions and results. They should try to visually communicate a clear mental model of how the system works. For example, the arrows on a keyboard indicate which direction the cursor moves when each key is pressed.

# **Constraint**

*Constraint* involves restricting the possible actions that are available to users at a given step. Constraint helps users answer the question, "What can I do?" If a user only has a limited number of options to interact with at any given moment, this helps them understand how to interact with the product. On the other hand, a cluttered interface with many possible actions could make it unclear how to interact with the product.

For example, a car's gearshift only provides the user with a few options. Avoid any unnecessary elements, and don't impede progress with forced distractions. Each control on the screen has a cost in the time that it takes for a user to parse and make decisions. Carefully consider the cost and keep the interface simple and clean.

# **Consistency**

*Consistency* means using consistent and easily recognizable elements across the user's experience with the product. Designs should keep widgets in consistent physical locations, use consistent styles, and make sure that similar tasks involve similar actions and elements. Leverage UI patterns and elements that users recognize and feel comfortable with.

For example, traffic lights have set a standard that green represents go and red represents stop—an effective design makes use of this universal understanding. Try to make users feel comfortable as they easily navigate the interface. Use a clear set of patterns in language, layout, and design throughout your product so that the user has a seamless experience.

To summarize, check out this video on design psychology principles and be prepared to use them in your designs: 

# **Viewport requirements in visual design planning**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to evaluate viewport requirements and apply responsive design methods to your own design process.*

To create great visual design, you need to ensure that you've put time and thought into which viewports you are designing for. To ensure that you're on track to create a successful deliverable, you'll evaluate the viewport requirements during this checkpoint.

# **Visual design viewport planning and responsive design**

As you learned earlier in this program, a *viewport* is the visible area of an app or web page. There are many resources that you can use to prepare for the viewport that you're delivering for. For example, Apple has very specific interface requirements and recommendations.

There are many viewports that you can design for. Viewports are typically determined by hardware:

- Phones
- Tablets
- Smartwatches
- Web
- Smart TVs
- Desktop software
- Kiosks
- ATMs
- Point-of-sale machines
- Digital billboards

In addition to the multitude of viewport types, there are also many form factors and sizes to accommodate. To create a good user experience, you'll need to define an effective strategy and plan to target a diverse range of devices, screen sizes, and abilities.

# **A short history of responsive design**

The explosion of mobile devices—and the rapid growth in their usage—changed the way that most designers work. All those new screens that flooded the market in 2008-2011 produced what many refer to as the *app economy*. With it, thousands of design and development shops sprang up to build iOS and Android applications.

Suddenly, the web at large was rapidly being replaced by a wave of purpose-built apps. The problem was that these apps were and largely still are *walled gardens*—they don't easily talk to one another. On the other hand, the web is open and free to all—but prior to 2011, it was largely trapped inside of desktop computers. The web that existed for mobile devices was basically either a shrunken version of what showed up on your desktop or a **[WAP site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol)**—a simplified website that you were redirected to if it was determined that you were on a mobile device.

Either way, the web on your phone wasn't the ideal experience that was promised with the arrival of smartphones in 2007. The popularity of smartphones and their mobile apps presented the open web with a do-or-die moment: either evolve or become obsolete.

That moment catalyzed a transformation for the open web as well as for the designers and developers who build experiences for it. The result is *responsive design*, a practice that creates different layouts depending on the viewport. Responsive design ensures that websites and apps continue to be functionally and aesthetically pleasing when users access them through different viewports.

# **An example of responsive design**

If you're designing a website for users to view in a browser, think through how the page should change if a user resizes their browser.

Check out this example of the BBC News website at maximum size, as viewed on a laptop:

Compare it to the following example, which shows a midsize version of the website:

And next, the browser is sized down to a quite small version. This is the layout that is used when the site is loaded on a mobile device:

Notice how the page changes as the size decreases:

- The navigation bar, or *nav bar*, collapses more and more categories into a **More** option.
- The content collapses into fewer columns.

By the smallest size, the nav bar collapses to just two options: **Latest Stories** and **Most Read**. The rest of the categories disappear into the **Menu** ☰ icon. Note: You may also see this icon called the "hamburger icon" or "burger menu."

# **How do you think the two remaining nav bar options, Latest Stories and Most Read, were chosen?**

These design choices were made carefully to ensure that the page would remain useful regardless of the viewport size, creating a *responsive* website. Making this happen involves coding techniques that are the job of the developer. But as a designer, you're involved too—your job is to provide the engineering team with all of the layouts and information needed so that the developers can code it properly.

# **Responsive design techniques**

# **Percentages**

In responsive design, percentages allow you to easily adapt to the available space. For example, instead of providing a mockup for every possible size, you can set rules. For example, you can set a rule that the lead content image is always 75% of the screen width. You may need to provide this type of information to your development team.

But percentages alone won't get you the kind of adaptation that you saw with the BBC News site. It wasn't just the relative sizes of content pieces that were changing—the actual elements on the page were changing too. These kinds of website changes are accomplished using *media queries*.

# **Media queries**

*Media queries* allow designers to alter their designs based on the size of the screen that the work is displayed on. In 2012, responsive design was the hottest thing that a designer could do, and media queries were the key to making this design evolution possible. A media query is a CSS coding technique used to describe at what size different layouts should be used. Remember, you don't need to worry about *how* it's done. As the designer, your focus is on *what* and *why.*

Media queries use *breakpoints* to say when a different layout should be displayed. Breakpoints are usually set using a list of maximum or minimum widths, measured in pixels (px).

For example, if you design a layout for small devices, then you might want to set a breakpoint for a maximum width of 575px. Then the layout is displayed on devices with viewports that are 575px wide or less, such as smartphones. And if you design a layout that you want to display on larger viewports, you could set a breakpoint for a minimum width of 1199px. That layout is used on viewports that are more than 1199px wide, such as desktop monitors.

Height can also be used to set breakpoints, but it is less common. This is because most people have a mental model of websites where they expect to need to scroll up and down, but not left and right.

There are **[many possible device breakpoints](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints)** that you can target. Here are the most common ones:

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/78ea67d2b9c24cefa2b98e877b8deb2e)

As a designer, you may need to provide developers with any layout changes related to different viewport sizes. You may also need to specify the breakpoints at which these changes should occur.

# **Mobile-first design**

It may be clear that layouts are easier to create if you have a lot of space to use. You can place items next to each other and leave enough space between them so that they do not appear crowded. But as the screen size decreases, you have to create simpler layouts. There are two ways that you can approach this.

You can start with the most complex layout and as many features as you like, and then try to remove features and rearrange elements to fit on a smaller screen. This approach is known as *graceful degradation*.

The other approach tackles the problem from the other direction. That is, design the page to work on the smallest screen first, and then progressively add features and rearrange the layout to take advantage of the larger screen sizes. This approach is known as *progressive enhancement*. As it turns out, progressive enhancement is the easier choice. It ensures that the user experience is good enough on all screens. If you construct a page that behaves well on the smallest screen, then you can assume that the page will also behave well on larger screens with no further work. By contrast, if you make a page that works well on a large screen, that doesn't guarantee that it will work well on smaller screens.

This approach of designing your pages to work on smaller screens first is also known as *mobile-first design*. This is the generally accepted approach for making web pages today.

Take a look at a version of the **[Thinkful website](https://www.thinkful.com/)** as an example. If you open the page on your phone, you'll get a layout that looks something like this:

The nav bar is collapsed into a **Menu** icon in the top right. All of the elements on the page are arranged vertically or in a column. If you were to open this page on a desktop and get the exact same layout, it would still be completely usable and look good, if a bit sparse. If the designer wanted, they could have stopped there.

But larger screens give designers and developers more real estate to work with, and the best websites take advantage of that fact. If you were to open the Thinkful website on a tablet, you'd get this layout instead:

The elements now have enough room to be arranged side by side, creating a more interesting layout and making space for more information before the user has to scroll.

Finally, if you were to open the Thinkful website on a desktop, you'd get this layout:

With the extra horizontal space, there's room for each of the links in the nav bar. The **Menu** icon disappears, and the user can get where they want to go with one fewer click.

These different layouts weren't created by accident. To make them, the designer of the site had to look at the way that the elements of the site were laid out across many different screens. Then they decided which layout would be suitable for each screen size.

Unfortunately, many websites are not responsive even today. Websites that aren't responsive lose users. This is because many people visit websites on their mobile devices at least some of the time—and, in many cases, all of the time. Here is an example of a website that is not responsive, as viewed on a phone:

Not a great user experience, right?

Before you read on, try visiting some of your favorite websites on both your phone and your computer. If you have a tablet available, look at the websites on your tablet, too. Do the websites look different on the different screens? Are they usable on the smaller screens? Do you think that the designer deliberately laid out the site to consider the smaller screen sizes? If so, then the website is responsive.

# **Mobile apps: Portrait and landscape**

Previously, you learned about viewport planning in website design. In mobile app design, many of the same practices apply—except the variance in size is usually limited to different mobile and tablet sizes.

A specific layout issue to consider is portrait versus landscape.

Most smartphones have a setting where the screen adjusts so that it's oriented correctly when the device is turned. When the phone is held in what is normally considered the upright position, the screen is in *portrait mode*. In portrait mode, the screen's height is always greater than its width.

When the phone is turned on its side, the screen is in *landscape mode*. In landscape mode, the screen's width is always greater than its height.

Changing the layout to match the way that the phone is being held is something that must be intentionally included in the app's functioning. Enable the autorotate setting on your phone, and then check some of your apps. Does the layout reorient when you turn your phone?

When designing a mobile app, be sure to consider how it looks in landscape mode. If the app needs layout differences between portrait and landscape, then you need to give developers mockups for both orientations. If the layout works as is when it's flipped, you'll still need to pay attention to orientation as part of your handoff to developers. You'll need to make sure that they know that coding in the ability to rotate is a necessary feature. When an app doesn't adjust to the phone's orientation, that can be an accessibility issue for someone with a physical disability. It's important that the app displays correctly regardless of how the phone is held.

# **Summary**

Creating responsive designs can feel a bit daunting at first. If you break it down and plan carefully, however, you can create designs that cover your users' needs and ensure that you reach your audience.

# 

# **Checkpoint**

# **Further developing your layout**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to apply the concepts of hierarchy, space, and grid systems to improve the functionality of layout designs.*

In this checkpoint, you'll explore the importance of hierarchy. You'll learn how it influences your designs, and you'll explore how to prioritize content properly. You'll examine how to use space in design, consider how space applies to the web, and understand the challenges of properly applying space. You will also learn how to use grid systems when designing for the web.

# **Hierarchy in design**

In visual design, *hierarchy* refers to how elements are arranged and presented on a page. Hierarchy implies emphasis and importance for certain elements. Through contrast, it defines which elements are more or less significant for the users to pay attention to.

# **Gestalt principles**

Hierarchy in design is based on **[Gestalt theory](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/gestalt-theory-10134960)**. This theory, which is also called the *law of simplicity*, proposes that elements are perceived in their simplest form.

There are five key principles to Gestalt psychological theory:

- **Similarity** is when similar elements appear to be related to each other. Introducing similarity reduces the complexity of a design. Similarity can be designed with size, color, and shape in mind.
- **Continuation** happens when a person's eye moves through an object to another. These separate objects are perceived as one.
- **Closure** is when an object feels incomplete or not closed in. Closure can involve multiple elements that are perceived as one object.
- **Proximity** occurs when elements are grouped or chunked together to form relationships.
- **Figure and ground** can also be thought of as the relationship between positive elements and negative space, which come from human perception. Figure is the object or objects in focus, while ground is the undifferentiated background. This relationship creates a visual stimulus.

Gestalt principles are often used across various forms of design. You can apply some of these concepts to your visual design for web applications and software.

# **Relationship of elements**

To determine how to structure content and elements, you can use the **[five hat racks approach](http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2013/07/20/the-five-and-only-five-ways-to-orgaize-information/)**. This approach, which was first popularized in **[Richard Saul Wurman's](https://www.wurman.com/)** book **[Information Anxiety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/952902.Information_Anxiety)**, can help you decide how to organize items so that they form a consistent visual hierarchy. According to the five hat racks approach, there are five ways to organize information:

- **Location:** Organizing elements by geographic or spatial location, like in a map or anatomical diagram. Consider organizing by location when orientation, geography, or physical placement is important.
- **Alphabetical:** Arranging content and information in an alphabetical sequence, like in a dictionary or book index. Consider organizing alphabetically when the reader is familiar with each term and may want to look up specific terms on a list.
- **Time:** Chronologically sorting information, such as in a timeline or a flowchart. Consider organizing by time when you want to emphasize historical context or a time-based sequence, or if you want to compare various durations.
- **Category:** Grouping elements that share similar features or content, such as types of animals or foods. Consider organizing by category when you can identify clusters of similarity among your elements.
- **Hierarchy** or **continuum:** Organizing elements by magnitude, like best to worst or highest to lowest. Consider organizing by this method if you are comparing elements across a single measure.

You may notice that all of the organizational methods described here relate to the concept of visual hierarchy that was introduced earlier. Your choice of organizational method emphasizes certain elements and characteristics, and it can strongly influence how users perceive the relationships between each element.

# **Contrasting properties**

When you're defining a visual hierarchy, you must create contrast between several properties of various elements. This indicates what has the most prominence in the content of a design.

There are several tools that you can use to define which elements are more or less important. You can establish contrast using color, type, scale, position, weight, alignment, shape, space, and depth. This contrast develops an effective visual hierarchy, and it can direct the user to the next step or action that they should take.

- **Color** can have an impact on a user's focus. You can use color to direct the user to an important action or element on a page.
- **Type** used in a design should be chosen for contrast as well as for visual personality. A successful typographic system can leverage fonts that are harmonious, while still achieving the necessary amount of contrast. You'll learn more about hierarchy in typography later in this checkpoint.
- **Scale** refers to the actual size of an element, based on attributes such as width, height, or font size.
- **Position** describes an element's place within the composition of a design. The position of similar or repeating elements is often alternated or staggered, which breaks up the redundancy of a design and adds visual interest.
- **Weight** relates to the amount of "mass" that an element possesses. The more weight an element has, the easier it is to draw the user's eye to it.
- **Alignment** pertains to the way that elements are arranged on a page based on their horizontal axis. Elements can be left-, center-, or right-aligned. By defining this property for each element, you can influence the hierarchy of how a user interacts with the content.
- **Shape** relates to the form of an element. Alternating shapes can easily differentiate elements by mixing more recognizable geometric shapes with less familiar organic shapes.
- **Spacing** is essential to the design of any website. Including whitespace around elements can emphasize the importance of that information. Less space around certain objects can reduce a user's focus.
- **Depth**, or **elevation**, is used to give elements the illusion of three-dimensional space in two-dimensional designs. Shadows are one of the easiest ways to create this effect and distinguish one element from another.

These properties play a valuable role in storytelling because they impact how the user perceives the information that is being presented.

# **Centers of interest**

As you begin to design your interfaces, it's important to highlight centers of interest. By prioritizing elements, you can define your visual hierarchy and place emphasis on key pieces of your design.

*Hero statements*, which are typically at the top of a landing or marketing page, help define what the product is, who it's for, and how to use it.

For most websites, a call to action is key to the success of the product that it's selling or promoting. Without some sort of user-based action, a site is just marketing content with no end result. Highlighting primary actions for users creates a sense of urgency. It makes it seem important for them to take the next step to discover what it is that you're selling.

Establishing patterns in your designs promotes consistency for designing other pages. This helps emphasize the key elements that the user should focus on and makes it easier for developers to build out the code.

# **Hierarchy in typography**

Typography is one part of design that requires hierarchy. Typography can help tremendously in defining the visual hierarchy of your designs. In web design and development, headings and subheadings help define hierarchy in typography.

Newspapers are well-versed in designing for hierarchy with typography in mind. In any newspaper, the biggest story of the day typically resides at the top with a large headline. As the reader moves down the page, the type begins to reduce in size. The stories in smaller type appear relatively less important than the large-text stories. Within each story, the different elements—like the byline and paragraph text—are also different sizes.

Using typeface scale is essential for emphasizing key phrases, paragraphs, and actions and capturing the attention of the user or reader before they move down the page. As a designer, it's on you to determine the sizes of these headings, paragraphs, and other text elements. You can use tools like **[Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com/)** to choose the sizes and ensure that the content is legible.

# **Space**

Layouts can be broken down into various elements. Within a design, there are macro and micro elements. *Macro elements* are the core sections of your design that make up a page. *Micro elements* are the smaller pieces of content and information that are applied to the macro elements.

For instance, the hero statement of a website is a macro element. Within this core element are micro elements, like a heading, tagline, and call-to-action button.

Space, which is often referred to as *whitespace* or *negative space*, is the area around the content. It provides breathing room for the elements so that the page doesn't appear cramped.

### One key thing to remember is that whitespace isn't always white in color.

When designing for core elements, it's essential to provide ample spacing between sections so that they don't merge and appear to conflict with each other. Using space around the micro elements also ensures that those items don't overlap, which would render the page unreadable and dysfunctional.

# **Benefits of space**

> "Use of whitespace between paragraphs and in the left and right margins increased comprehension by almost 20%." —DYM Lin, Computers in Human Behavior
> 

Space, when used properly, can enhance the experience for a user. There are many benefits to using space within your designs. In this section, you'll explore these benefits and the effects that they can provide.

Space can improve the legibility of content, allowing users to quickly read, understand, and take action.

If you look at the following image, you'll see that the two examples have exactly the same content. However, it's easier to read and scan the version on the right side.

Space can also draw the user's attention to the importance of an element. If you provide additional space around calls to action or specific trigger elements, the user can quickly determine what their next step should be.

For example, the following image shows two different uses of space in a sign-up button. The button on the left lacks space, which makes it blend in with the rest of the content. In contrast, the right side provides a clear direction for the user.

Space can also provide hierarchy in your designs, allowing you to prioritize the importance of content in addition to balance. By using space to enhance the experience, websites can become more elegant and graceful for the user, rather than complex and confusing.

# **Examples of space**

# **Apple**

![http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Apple.jpg](http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Apple.jpg)

**[Apple](http://www.apple.com/)** has consistently used whitespace to direct the user's attention to specific elements on its site. For example, its home page uses ample but subtle space that confers importance to its main section. The micro space between the text adds a clear indication of hierarchy and legibility to the products that it is showcasing.

# **Numi**

![http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Numi.jpg](http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Numi.jpg)

**[Numi](http://numi.io/)** uses a simple landing page that uses a lot of space within the hero statement and the micro elements inside of it. The page focuses on describing the product and allowing the user to download it.

# **Medium**

![http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Medium.jpg](http://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-design/design-fundamentals/space/Medium.jpg)

**[Medium](http://www.medium.com/)** uses space to create division between its content. In the upper part of the page, the hero statement encompasses the majority of the screen. Below that, a feed provides the user with links to explore. On pages that display articles or blog posts, the space between the text allows for easy scanning and good legibility—even with user-generated content.

# **Challenges**

When it comes to designing with space in mind, there are challenges that you need to account for. The business requirements of the site or app come first and foremost because they can influence how elements are structured and prioritized. These requirements can also affect the space between macro and micro elements; your design should ensure that users understand what they need to accomplish.

One concept that you've already heard a bit about is called the *fold*. As you may recall, information that is *above the fold* refers to the content that appears above the scroll portion of the website. It was originally used to define the area on a newspaper that appeared before the crease in the newspaper. The most important information in a newspaper typically resides in this area.

This concept applies to web design, too. Even though many **[users are scrolling](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/)** more than they used to, it's advisable to include clear and concise instructions and information above the fold. Think about what you want users to see as soon as they land on a page within your website, and consider how you can encourage them to scroll below the fold. Users are often willing to scroll to view more, but only if they find a reason to.

**[Mod Notebooks](https://modnotebooks.com/)** uses the entire fold to display three key areas and their associated calls to action. As the user scrolls, the page depicts a story about the product. This gives the user a reason to continue viewing additional information.

Space can also help with the amount of information designed on a page. If there's too much information, the performance load becomes too high. This increases the effort to accomplish a task, which makes it less likely to happen. To decrease the *cognitive* (mental) and *kinematic* (physical) loads, there are several steps that you can take. You can eliminate unnecessary information that's displayed. You can reduce the number of steps necessary to complete an action. You can chunk information together so that the user can digest the content more easily. And you can add whitespace between sections and elements.

Much like the Mod Notebooks website, the following page shown has a ton of information. But its use of space breaks each section down, reducing the amount of content that the user sees at one time.

# **Space in CSS**

In front-end development, the *box model* defines how elements are laid out. Imagine all elements as boxes on a page. These boxes are defined by four attributes, as shown in the following image.

All of these items make up the total calculated width of an element. In the following example, the following attributes have been defined:

`width: 300px`

`padding: 10px`

`border: 5px solid black`

`margin: 10px`

So here's how to calculate the element's size:

`10px (left margin) + 5px (left border) + 10px (left padding) +`

`300px (width) + 10px (right padding) + 5px (right border) +`

`10px (right margin) = 350px`

Developers use width, padding, border, and margins in CSS to recreate the spacing of designs in code. So that you can discuss the layout of elements with your development team, it is important that you understand how these properties translate to your design.

# **Grids**

Developers and designers alike use *grids* to organize and communicate layout.

> "The grid makes it possible to bring all the elements of design—type characters, photography, drawing, and color—into a formal relationship to each other; that is to say, the grid system is a means to introducing order into a design. A deliberately composed design has a clearer, more neatly arranged, and more successful effect than an advertisement put together at random." —Josef Müller Brockmann, The Graphic Artist and his Design Problems
> 

# **Why use grids?**

> "The benefits of working with a grid are simple: clarity, efficiency, economy, and continuity." —Timothy Samara, Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop
> 

Grids help split pages horizontally and vertically, using rows and columns. Grid systems are systematic approaches that allow designers to lay out elements in an organized manner. They provide a modular approach to designing components for multiple pages or layouts. Using grids speeds up the design process while ensuring consistency.

When you're designing for web and mobile apps, you'll design many pages or views to create various user flows. Grids ease the process of developing templates, which standardize layouts for similar pages.

# **Types of grids**

You'll explore five different types of grids that are commonly used in both print and digital design: block grids, column grids, module grids, hierarchical grids, and baseline grids.

# **Block grid**

A *block grid*, also referred to as *manuscript grid* or *single-column grid*, is primarily used for large blocks of text—much like those used within books. With a block grid, typography plays a key role because of its simplicity. The block usually consists of text, but designers also integrate images and other elements to fill the width of the grid.

Wide margins on the sides can narrow the content and help the eye, which increases the readability of the large blocks of text.

# **Column grid**

The column grid, which comprises multiple columns, is one of the most commonly used grids in the design world. Column grids provide a lot of flexibility for organizing information. Each column can be dependent, independent, or cross over within each other. This type of grid allows designers to chunk information or elements together while keeping sections separate.

Within a column grid, gutters help create space between each column so that the columns aren't bumping into one another. Margins on the right and left sides of each column make up the gutter.

# **Module grid**

Module grids function similarly to column grids, but they also break into horizontal sections to form rows. This grid system lends itself to integrating elements such as image galleries and charts. Dashboard designs with several components typically feature module grid structures.

Breaking the layout into a module grid helps define small chunks of information. It promotes a minimalistic approach and retains objectivity and order within the design.

# **Hierarchical grid**

Hierarchical grids rely on the intuitive placement of elements, resulting in a more organic layout. Different column widths are applied to various elements or components on the page to indicate importance and feature different kinds of information.

# **Baseline grid**

Baseline grids are often used to organize and properly size vertical space between elements. The vertical grid eliminates the need to eyeball the proper spacing, and it allows text to be applied systematically within a layout. Using a baseline grid helps develop a vertical rhythm of elements and type. This helps the layouts feel more polished and intentionally designed.

The horizontal lines in a baseline grid can be used to vertically align text, but the way this works is slightly different in web development than it is in print publishing. Even if you only design for the web, you may see people refer to the print terminology—so you need to know the difference between these two methods.

In print, the bottom of every line of text sits on the horizontal lines of a baseline grid—just like it does when you write on a lined piece of paper. Typographic spacing in print is measured in terms of *leading*, which refers to the space between each horizontal line. So if you increase the leading, then the space above each line of text will increase. But in web development, the text floats midway between each horizontal line rather than sitting directly on top of the lines. In this context, the space between each horizontal line is called *line-height*. If you increase the line-height, then extra space will be added both above and below each line of text. And instead of lining up text on top of the grid lines, you'll line up text within them.

It's recommended to apply a six-pixel (`6px`) baseline grid, so all leading is a multiple of three.

# **History of grids**

The defined concept of grids wasn't introduced until the mid-1900s. But even before then, the process of laying out content on pages relied on various structures that resembled the grids that designers use today. This was especially true for books. Before the invention of the printing press, manuscripts and books primarily featured single-column grid layouts. Scribes used different sizes and colors to emphasize importance within their handwritten texts.

Graphic designer **[Josef Müller-Brockmann](http://www.designishistory.com/1940/joseph-mueller-brockmann/)** was a major influence in the modernization and popularization of grid structures. He emphasized their critical importance for creating order and precision in design.

# **Golden ratio and rectangles**

The **[golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)**, which is often referred to as divine proportion, is a mathematical concept that can also be applied to design. Roughly, it equals 1.618. A golden rectangle, for example, is a rectangle with a length that is 1.618 times its width.

Some websites use the golden ratio to help lead users' eyes to points on the page. It helps designers think about the hierarchy and placement of content. For instance, a standard content-sidebar layout can be defined by the golden ratio. If the content area is 640 pixels wide, the sidebar should be roughly 400 pixels wide, as shown in the following image.

# **Constructing a grid system**

To build a grid system for web design, it's important that you understand the anatomy of a grid. Standard layouts consist of 6, 9, or 12 columns. Sometimes, designers can break that standard and use however many columns they find necessary. Next, you'll review the anatomy of a grid and explore how to set one up.

# **Anatomy of a grid**

When establishing a grid, there are key parts that define the size and ratio of the structure. Take a look at the following diagram:

*Margins* are the empty spaces on all edges of the document.

*Columns* are vertical sections that span the height of the content area. *Rows* are the horizontal sections that span the width of the content area.

The *gutter* is the space between each column or row that creates division between each element.

# **How to set up a grid in Figma**

Within Figma, you can create a grid with ease. Upon creating a new file, you need to add a frame. Once you have selected **Frame** from the **Region Tools** drop-down menu in the navigation bar, select **Desktop HD** from the **Design** panel.

To create a grid, select your frame and then click the **+** icon in the **Layout Grid** section of the panel.

Several options will appear; select the **Grid** icon, which allows you to change the type of grid that you would like to apply to your page and specify the number of columns or rows that you desire.

Figma provides a responsive grid for designers to work with. To see the basic process and learn more about using grids in Figma, check out the following video.

# 

# **How to set up a grid in Sketch**

Setting up a grid in Sketch is also relatively easy. Upon creating a new file, you need to add an artboard. Under the presets, select **Desktop HD**.

To adjust the grid layout, select **View** and click **Show Layout**. With the **Layout** panel open, you can adjust your layout and grid settings to develop a grid-based layout.

# **Breaking the grid**

> "The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee ... But one must learn how to use the grid system; it is something that has to be practiced." —Josef Müller Brockmann, The Graphic Artist and His Design Problems
> 

Although grids can help to keep information clean and consistent, there are times when you can break free from the grid. This can enhance the subtle detail of your designs.

A grid is a guide in designing with consistency. But by shifting images, blockquotes, or other elements off of the grid, you can add touches without creating chaos.

Grids can also be changed. You're not required to adhere to a single grid system for all pages within a web app. Grids should be used to help lay out the content effectively for the needs of the users. Different views may need adjustments based on the content consumed. For instance, the marketing home page of a web app doesn't always use the same grid system as the internal application. It's a matter of designing for the content while trying to remain as consistent as possible.

# **Summary**

# **Intro to branding**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will apply your research, requirements, and other specifications to define a brand and create a mood board.*

In this checkpoint, you'll explore the ins and outs of building and growing a brand, with the goal of creating a product or experience that is memorable, recognizable, and inspiring. You'll learn many key concepts and consider strategies for listening to your stakeholders, clients, and users in the brand development process.

# **Logos and brands**

A logo is not the same thing as a brand. A product's brand is much more than just its visual representation—it is the essence of the company that is expressed through its products, services, and people. Although the identity is a component of the overall brand, there are numerous factors that influence a product's success:

- **Brand identity** is the logo and other associated visuals that people connect to a product. The brand identity is one of the first recognizable elements of a product's brand.
- **Brand image** is how people perceive a product in their minds.
- **Brand positioning** is how a product is marketed and the audience that it's marketed to.
- **Brand personality** refers to the emotional and personal qualities that a brand possesses and how people relate to the brand.
- **Brand equity** is the value of a brand. This can be in terms of financial value, market share, revenue, strategic benefits, or other metrics.
- **Brand experience** is the overall experience that a person has with a brand when they interact with it or purchase a product associated with it.
- **Brand differentiation** is how a product stands out, which is essential to its success.
- **Brand communication** refers to the messaging delivered through various platforms, like advertising, brochures, and a brand's website.
- **Brand gap** is the difference between what a brand promises to deliver and the actual results.
- **Brand extension** is how a brand goes beyond the original intent, expanding into other markets or industries as part of its growth.

All of these elements are part of the brand development process, and they are important in understanding how to increase brand awareness. The brand identity is only a small portion of this, but it visualizes the promise delivered through all components of the process.

# **The brand-building process**

Here's a common five-stage version of the brand-building process:

1. **Discovery:** The discovery stage focuses on conducting essential research to find out more about the company, the products, and the overall mission of the brand. Typically, you'll receive a creative brief that lists the details, any market research that's been conducted already, and the objectives for the project.
2. **Interpretation:** Interpretation involves using mind mapping to quickly generate some basic word associations. Armed with these concepts, you can validate your strategy for developing the brand using the information gathered in the discovery stage.
3. **Exploration:** In the exploration stage, the pen meets the paper. This is where you can begin to sketch out rough concepts or sketches to share with stakeholders, users, and other designers.
4. **Creation:** The creation stage is the execution of the refined brand assets. In this stage, you can begin to create various versions of the brand identity and strategy to be approved by the company's stakeholders.
5. **Delivery:** Once everything has been approved, delivery is the final step of the brand creation process. In this stage, you deliver the completed, refined files, along with all other associated components. You and your team present your work and share the story of the brand.

### In the design world, many of the same design terms—such as discovery and delivery—are repurposed and applied to different concepts. These overlapping and repeating words can be confusing at first. But once you're on the job, you'll get accustomed to the specific vocabulary used in your company and industry.

# **Branding guidelines**

During the discover phase of the design process, you'll document style guide requirements. You'll use these requirements now to create a *mood board*. Your mood board uses imagery, typography, colors, voice, and texture to capture the essence of the product definition.

In your career as a designer, sometimes you'll be given already-established branding guidelines, and sometimes you'll be tasked with creating them. To make sure that you have a thorough understanding of how to create branding guidelines, you're going to spend some time diving into the creation and thinking process during this checkpoint. Keep in mind that when brand guidelines, logos, and other aspects are already defined, you'll review these in detail and then move into creating the visual design.

There are a lot of interesting and compelling ways that you can design your bus app, but you probably don't have a clear vision for it just yet. That's all right. You don't have to conjure something out of thin air. Think back to the processes of exploration and discovery for developing a brand, which you learned about earlier in this program. Those are important steps, and they'll be a part of the assignment for this checkpoint. You can also leverage some of the work that you did earlier in this project to kick-start your branding work.

# **The discovery stage**

Everything starts with research. The earlier checkpoints involved extrapolating unanswered questions from the client's brief and using that as a basis for your research. That initial research can now form the basis for your branding.

What did you learn about your target markets? What problems are your users trying to solve?

Your research and findings affect your branding decisions because they set the context for the product. This is vital so that you can establish a tone.

# **Working with real-world clients**

In real-world contexts, the discovery stage of the branding process involves defining the business requirements with your key stakeholders. For the final outcome of the brand, it's essential to get accurate information from those closest to the project. You need to make sure that you satisfy their requirements and understand their business goals.

Here are some questions that you should ask about their business goals:

- What is your business or product, and what does it do?
- Who are the main competitors? What do you like about their brand? What do you dislike?
- What is unique about your product or company? What story do you want to tell your users?
- What sets your product apart from the products of your competitors?
- What are some words that describe your business?
- Why do you want to create a brand or a new brand?
- Do you have specific requirements for the color palette?

Achieving success in your branding process also depends on understanding who your clients are targeting. There are several key questions that you need to ask before beginning. You can obtain the answers to these questions through methods like questionnaires, interviews, and worksheets.

Here are a few examples:

- Can you describe your ideal user?
- Do you have current research to show your ideal user?
- What problem are you trying to solve for your users?
- Why should people use your product instead of a product from one of your competitors?
- What message do you want to communicate to your users?

In addition to learning about business needs and users, it's also a best practice to learn about the stakeholders' preferences and opinions:

- What isn't working with your current brand?
- What other brands inspire you?
- What brands do you find unattractive?
- Can you describe your desired look and story for the brand?

Finally, be sure to ask about scope and logistics:

- Who are the key stakeholders for this project?
- What is the timetable for completion?
- What is your budget?
- What deliverables do you need for your brand?
- Do you have any current material that needs to be adjusted with this brand?

These are the questions that you need to explore before developing a brand. They'll often lead to more questions—and that's good. This is the time to explore. Look for connections. Try to look through the perspective of personas and think about what might make a brand interesting or attractive to them. By gathering this information and speaking with your clients, you'll discover a lot about what they hope to accomplish. This helps you complete the project with a brand identity that they are happy with.

# **The interpretation stage**

In the interpretation stage, the main objective is to establish the direction and gain a consensus on that direction.

Start by explaining the process of brand identity creation. Then you can develop a project or creative brief that defines the problem, goal, and key insights. The brief should also identify the types of users that you'll target. Out of this creative brief, you should be able to define the main message to the user and create a list of opportunities.

# **The exploration stage**

Within the exploration stage, you need to understand the main elements of the brand's identity. The brand identity—the visuals that people connect with the brand's products—comes in many forms, including names, marks, symbols, and taglines.

*Name* is the basic indicator of a brand. It's used for communication as well as brand awareness. When you're building a brand from scratch, in order to be unique, it's essential to use a name that has no current associations. You can generate alternative names through word association or metaphors. A brand name should be memorable and should help create a mental picture that evokes an emotion.

*Marks* and *symbols* are images that represent the brand and supplement the name. For instance, Nike's swoosh, Target's red target, and McDonald's golden arches are three of the most recognizable brand marks. Even without the brand name, most people can associate the mark with its brand. This is true even for very young potential users.

*Taglines*, or *slogans*, are similar to symbols in that they supplement a brand name. They can help elicit emotional responses from users or consumers, but they need to be linked to the name. Taglines can change and evolve over time through a brand's lifespan. For example, take a look at **[this list of all the different taglines that McDonald's has used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_McDonald%27s_ad_programs#United_States)**.

# **Competitive analysis**

Upon exploring the different treatments of the possible brand identity, you must examine the competitive landscape. To do this, you'll conduct a *competitive analaysis*. Start with the competitors that your stakeholders mentioned, but look into other potential competitors too. Through this exercise, you can pick apart unique opportunities to explore through the use of type styles, colors, and other graphic elements.

Without a deep understanding of the competitive landscape, it is very easy to create a brand very similar to your competition—which at best is lazy, and at worst could cause you legal issues if someone decided to sue. When in doubt, do your homework.

# **Establishing a mood**

When you're trying to express a brand's characteristics, you may find that words often get in the way. A slightly different understanding of the same word can result in very unexpected outcomes. When a client says that they are looking for something "edgy," you're thrust into the realm of a mind reader. A person's interpretation of a word like "edgy" depends on who they are and what they have experienced in life.

Somehow, you have to find a way to consistently cut through the noise and ambiguity that arises from these conversations. Luckily, you have tools to do that. Mood boards help establish the feel and direction for a project. Think of a mood board as a way to collect and share ideas and inspiration visually.

Although mood boards are typically associated with interior design work, they aren't limited to a single domain. When a writer sets out to write a new book, they often do ample research on a topic or author so that they can adopt a specific style. In the same vein, musicians often create mixtapes to seed their composition with new influences that they hope will bubble up through the creative process. In short, you can use mood boards to provide inspiration for the type of work that you hope to create.

Mood boards typically fall into one of two categories:

- The art school collage
- The presentation template

The collage approach is a collection of designs, pictures, colors, textures, and words that inspire you. In this approach, sometimes you'll include specific elements that end up in your final design. Other times, you'll show elements that you think evoke a particular feeling. Perhaps you'll want to find something like those elements for your design. The goal of the collage approach is to get your ideas down so that they can be conveyed quickly. Rough edges are expected, and imperfections are left untouched.

In the presentation template version of the mood board, clean and crisp edges dominate. Images align in grids, and the typography has plenty of space to breathe. The overall feel of this approach is very structured.

# **How to create a mood board**

What tools should you use to create your mood board? There are templates available for all major design applications. There are also apps specifically designed for creating mood boards. **[Moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/)**, for example, is a free application that allows you to gather and add inspirational elements or designs to showcase to your stakeholders.

Based on the creative brief that you and your stakeholders developed, gather elements that reflect the appropriate aesthetics for your brand. Consider typography, colors, imagery, iconography, and other items. Show your mood boards to clients to gauge their reactions and responses, and use that information to begin defining what works and adheres to the brand story.

# **Summary**

You've now learned about the discovery, interpretation, and exploration stages of creating a brand. Next, you'll go into more depth with typography, color, and logo design.

# **Typography**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will apply your research, requirements, and other specifications to define a brand and create a typographical guide.*

The history of written communication systems goes all the way back to Sumerian clay tablets. For centuries, it has been common practice to communicate using a series of glyphs. Nowadays, we rely on these repeated shapes to visually communicate words and ideas every day—but very few people stop to understand how type works.

*Typography* is everywhere. From the computer screen that you are staring at now to the signage that you see in store windows, type is literally all around you. It is because of this very ubiquity that type is so often overlooked.

People tend to develop a herd mentality when it comes to type. The average person's consideration of type is limited to what feels familiar. To make matters worse, people gravitate to typefaces that they *think* they recognize from other places. This frequently leads to selecting an inappropriate typeface for the job (such as using Comic Sans on an office memo).

This leads to a fear of typography—a fear that has no place in the mind of a capable designer. You need to break through the herd mentality and develop an understanding of how type works. In this checkpoint, you'll start your journey with the basic tenets of typography, and then you'll work your way to the finer details.

# **Serif, sans serif, and script typefaces**

A *serif* typeface can be identified by the little "feet" that accompany the letterforms. These "feet" are called serifs. The serif is an artifact from the era before the printing press, when words were painted or drawn.

"Sans" is French for "without"—so as you might guess, *sans serif* typefaces are typefaces that do not have serifs attached to the characters. Sans serif typography was developed during the Machine Age, when typographers began to have more precise tools to create new typefaces. This allowed them to forego the older methods of type creation, in which serifs were a necessity.

*Script* is a typeface that mimics handwriting. The characters are sometimes connected together, as with cursive.

In general, sans serif typefaces are more legible than serif typefaces—and they are much more legible than script typefaces. You should be very, very cautious about choosing a script typeface for body text.

Each type has certain feelings associated with it. Serif typefaces are traditional and give a feeling of authority, security, custom, and history. Sans serif typefaces are modern and give a feeling of minimalism, progress, and clarity. Scripts often feel elegant, unique, or personalized.

# **The parts of type**

When learning about type, it isn't enough to simply spot the structural differences in typefaces. A capable designer can discuss typography at an atomic level; you'll need to pay attention to the discrete parts of type that combine to create a glyph. So take some time to get familiar with the parts of type described below: ascender, aperture, arm, axis, baseline, bowl, cap height, counter, crossbar, descender, ear, eye, hook, leg, link, loop, shoulder, spine, stem, tail, terminal, and x-height.

# **Ascender**

An *ascender* is a typographical element of a lowercase glyph that extends upward beyond the x-height associated with that typeface.

---

# **Aperture**

An *aperture* is an unclosed opening of negative space that's naturally created by the curvature of the glyph.

---

# **Arm**

An *arm* is a horizontal or upward stroke that connects with the glyph on only one end.

---

# **Axis**

The *axis* is the tilt of a glyph. It is often best seen by bisecting a glyph's top and bottom strokes at their thinnest point.

# **Baseline**

The *baseline* is the common point on which all characters in a line of type rest.

# **Bowl**

A *bowl* is a curved line that connects with the stem of a glyph to enclose a negative space.

# **Cap height**

The *cap height* is the top point of the capital letters in a typeface.

# **Counter**

The *counter* is the interior element that is associated with a glyph. The bowl of an `a` and the eye of an `e` are considered counters.

# **Crossbar**

The *crossbar* is a horizontal stroke that connects to a glyph on both ends.

# **Descender**

A *descender* is a typographical element that extends downward, beyond the baseline of that typeface. Descenders are associated with some lowercase characters.

# **Ear**

An *ear* is an ornamental swash typically found on the upper portion of a lowercase `g`.

# **Eye**

An *eye* is an enclosed opening of space associated with lowercase characters.

# **Hook**

A *hook* is a curving arc that connects a terminal with the rest of the glyph structure.

# **Leg**

A *leg* is a downward stroke that connects with the glyph on only one end.

# **Link**

A *link* is a stroke that connects two counters together.

# **Loop**

A *loop* is a descender feature typically associated with the bottom of the lowercase `g`.

# **Shoulder**

A *shoulder* is an arch that connects with the stem of a glyph.

# **Spine**

The *spine* is the curve of the `S` that holds the top and bottom of the character together.

# **Stem**

The *stem* is the vertical backbone of most glyphs that do not have a natural curve in their structure.

# **Tail**

A *tail* is a stroke that descends away from the rest of the glyph structure. The tail is often exaggerated for the purpose of ornamentation or decoration.

# **Terminal**

The *terminal* is the end of any character, not including the serif. Both serif and sans serif glyphs can have terminals.

# **X-height**

The *x-height* is the height of lowercase letters without an ascender or descender. X-height is a key indicator of how readable a typeface is.

# **The skeleton of type**

One of the reasons that designers obsess over type is because of its expressive nature. So much of that expression originates in the underlying structure of each typeface. Although there are many subcategories of type structure, most typefaces can be classified as either humanist or geometric.

# **Humanist**

*Humanist typefaces* have their roots in the 15th century; they are directly connected with the advent of the printing press. The structure of Humanist fonts is linked with the way that characters were created in the era before the printing press, when everything was crafted by hand. Hand-drawn characters generally have uneven line weights and open counters, and these characteristics are reflected in humanist type.

Sans serif humanist typeface came later, and they maintain the same skeletal structure of their serif forerunners. Fonts like Frutiger and Myriad keep the underlying skeleton of a humanist font, but they are simpler than their serif counterparts. These fonts are more legible and friendly because they lack the rigidity of machine-made forms.

# **Geometric**

*Geometric typefaces* are based on simple geometric shapes like the square, circle, and triangle. You can typically identify a geometric typeface by looking at the `O`, `M`, and `A`. The `O`, for example, is circular in a geometric typeface. Unlike humanist typefaces, they have even line weights. Proxima and Avenir are two popular examples of geometric typefaces.

# **Adjusting typography to suit the context**

After choosing a typeface, there are several other choices to make that relate to size and spacing.

# **Scale**

*Scale* is size, especially relative to other elements. Typographic scale is about more than just drawing attention to information by increasing the font size. To master scale, you have to understand *when* to make type bigger or smaller. Studying examples and ensuring legibility through usability testing helps you make scale-related choices.

# **Tracking and kerning**

*Tracking*, or *letter spacing*, refers to the space between all glyphs in a text. When you're using small type, you might increase the tracking to make your type more legible. For very large text, decreasing the tracking may improve the look.

*Kerning* is easily confused with tracking. Kerning refers to adjusting the space between two specific glyphs to make sure that the typeface feels balanced. For example, in the bottom-right example below, the letters `V` and `A` are kerned to be closer together than they would be if they followed the overall tracking. Otherwise, there would appear to be too much space between the two letters—which you can see in the bottom-left example.

**[Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/kerning-and-tracking-typography-1074965)**

# **Usage standards**

Across the web, there are a number of standards that govern font choices. There are no rules that dictate that typography in navigation links must be between 12px and 16px—but if you look at some of the most popular sites online, you can see that most navigation typography does fall neatly into that range.

While there are always exceptions, it's important to be aware of the expectations that have been set. Below are some of the common font sizes associated with various parts of digital products.

# **Mobile considerations**

The font sizes listed in the chart are standard for large-screen experiences. But when that typography finds its way onto a mobile device, it is suddenly out of scale for its new environment.

The interesting challenge with mobile typography is how to transition. It isn't as simple as making all the fonts bigger or smaller. Instead, headlines become a bit smaller, while paragraphs become a little larger.

Although you won't be tasked with coming up with comprehensive typography solutions yet, knowing now what is expected from you can help you when the time comes.

# **Width matters**

Typographer Robert Bringhurst delivered **["the finest book ever written about typography"](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/08/10-essential-books-on-typography/242883/)** with his classic **[The Elements of Typographic Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326)**. In his book, Bringhurst introduces designers to the *66 character rule*. This rule states that 66 characters (including spaces) is the ideal width for a line of type when the goal is to achieve maximum clarity and readability.

But this rule requires some qualifiers. The 66 character rule is about paragraph text set at 16px. And it doesn't apply at all for mobile typography. The narrower width on mobile devices doesn't allow for 66 characters to be displayed, unless the type is too small to be readable.

# **Alignment**

There is a tendency in designers to want to balance the design that they are working on. This has to do with the *alignment* of the text.

The desire for balance or symmetry can tempt most designers to center typography on the screen. Although centering type isn't necessarily bad, you have to be careful not to center too much text. Long passages of centered type are extremely difficult to read. The eye has to constantly seek out the beginning of the next line. This causes stress; eventually, the reader may give up altogether. So while it is okay to center a few words or a couple of sentences, anything longer than a paragraph should be considered a usability issue.

*Justified alignment* is another common pitfall. It was designed for the limited space found in newspapers. But digital products have no such limitations, so the usage of justified alignment is highly discouraged.

*Right alignment* is generally frowned upon in languages that are read from left to right. The same is true of left alignment in languages that are read from right to left. In both cases, the alignment makes it unnecessarily difficult for the reader to consume the content.

So, here's the bottom line: For paragraphs of text, you should use the alignment that matches the direction in which the language is read.

# **Line spacing**

Although typographic space was mentioned briefly in an earlier checkpoint, its mechanics were not discussed in detail.

*Line spacing* refers to the vertical distance between two lines of text. This is referred to in a number of different ways: *leading* for print, *line-height* for CSS, and *single-spaced* or *double-spaced* if you are in a word processor.

When your goal is maximum legibility, the amount of space that you should have between lines is directly related to the size of your typography. In most instances, something between 120% and 150% of the size of your typography is most pleasing to the eye.

Line spacing larger than the ranges listed above can begin to feel too sparse—so if you choose to use larger line spacing, do it sparingly. It is also worth noting that line spacing has a much greater impact on the overall length of your document than type size does.

# **A note about pixels, points, ems, and rems**

As you work more with typography, you'll begin to see size references that can be confusing to new designers. Although type measurements will be discussed in further detail later in this program, these topics are easier to understand if you learn the basics now.

# **A breakdown of measurements for type**

# **Points**

*Points* are the smallest unit of measurement in typography. Although many people say that there are 72 points in an inch, 1 point is equal to 0.013836 inch—so 72 points actually equal 0.996264 inch. Elements that use point size reproduce at the same size anywhere that they are used in print.

Points have a typographic counterpart in the pica, which won't be discussed in detail here because you probably won't use it much on the job.

# **Pixels**

*Pixels* are the smallest unit of measurement on a screen, but the actual size of each pixel is controlled by the screen itself.

For a long time, pixels and points were fairly equal; most screens displayed at 72 pixels per inch (PPI). That aligned nicely with 72 points per inch from the world of print, and things were relatively easy. But as screen resolutions increased, the standards changed. For instance, the first retina screens for the iPhone were 144 PPI. In other words, screen resolution doubled—and the result was that a headline set at 16px on an older iPhone would display at 8px on a newer one.

Although pixels are absolute in their size, they are very inconsistent. Using pixels can be extremely frustrating if you aren't careful.

Most design programs that you will be using, like Illustrator and Sketch, handle this issue by letting you output your work at a higher resolution. This is because they are **[vector-based programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics_editor)**. This means that you'll continue to work at the 72-PPI standard, and then you can simply export your files at the size needed for the higher resolution.

# **Ems and rems**

Both *ems* and *rems* are relative measurement units, which means that their size is dictated by something else in the code.

Although you won't spend a lot of time with these right now, all of the typography that you build in your front-end projects will use one of these measurements.

A single em (1em) could technically be any size that you decide to declare. You are in control of the measurement in your project. Rems (which is short for *root ems*) work in the same basic way, but rems handle issues **[like cascading](https://codepen.io/3mpetri/pen/QyyJLg)** better than ems.

Both measurements are purpose-built for displaying content on a variety of different screen types, and both can be used in contexts beyond just type. But don't try to use them in Figma or Sketch, because they are code-only units of measure.

### Because typography is such a ubiquitous part of websites, creating strong typographic design patterns is essential for a successful design. If you're interested in seeing more real-world examples of good typography, check out **[Thinkful's Pattern Library](https://courses.thinkful.com/pdf-res-v1/checkpoint/3)**.

# **The big picture**

Now you know all the nitty-gritty details of type that you may have never considered before. But the question remains: How do you choose typefaces for your projects?

# **Be conservative**

Limit yourself to no more than three fonts: one for the logo or mark, one for headings or other centers of interest, and one for body text. However, be conscious of your choices. Don't use three fonts when two or even one is sufficient.

Consider whether you really need that custom typeface. Often, standard fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri, and Trebuchet work perfectly well. These typefaces have the added benefit of increased readability due to their familiarity.

# **Combine with care**

Combining different typefaces is an art, but there are some guidelines to help you as you develop more confidence:

- **Combine a serif typeface and a sans serif typeface.** Some typefaces have both serif and sans serif versions, and some offer several different options for weight and spacing.
- **Choose typefaces with a similar mood or feeling.** Using typefaces that look dramatically different from one another can make your text jarring and difficult to read.
- **Use a combination generator.** If you search online for "font combination generator," you'll find many applications that recommend combinations based on an initial font that you select. Check out **[Canva's font combination tool](https://www.canva.com/font-combinations/)** to give one a try.

*Image source*: **[Canva font combination tool](https://www.canva.com/font-combinations/)**

# **Accessibility**

Your choice of typeface has a huge impact on the accessibility of your product. Poor type choices can render your website or app extremely difficult to read. This can especially affect people with vision impairments and reading impairments like dyslexia.

# **Accessible typefaces**

Sans serif typefaces are generally considered the best for legibility. Serif typefaces can add additional visual clutter or cause words to appear blurry. Scripts can be extremely difficult for people to read. Some commonly recommended fonts are Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, Century Gothic, and Calibri.

# **Create contrast**

*Image source*: **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**

Although sans serif typefaces may be the most legible, this doesn't mean that you can't use serif fonts or scripts. You can increase the legibility of these typefaces by increasing the size and the color contrast between the type and the background.

Color contrast is important so that you can maintain visibility for all readers. Always check your choices with an accessibility tool. **[Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/)** is a great tool that allows you to generate palettes that provide appropriate contrast for your font choices.

The larger type is, the higher the contrast and legibility will be. Try to avoid using anything below 12pt font for body content. You should also check how your font appears at various sizes; users may be on different devices or may zoom in to improve their experience.

# **Other useful adjustments**

Increasing tracking by a small amount can assist people with certain vision or reading impairments. Wherever possible, avoid italics and opt for bolding for emphasis.

# **Webfonts**

There are many websites that offer free fonts, and you may be tempted to visit one of them so that you can incorporate some unique fonts into your designs. But this can cause a big problem on a website. Browsers display fonts that are saved locally on your users' computers. If the font used on the site isn't found, the browser chooses something else in the same family to display, like a generic sans serif or serif font. This means that your typographical choices might end up looking all wrong on different users' devices.

Some fonts, like Arial, Helvetica, and Georgia, are considered *web-safe fonts*. This is because the vast majority of computers have them installed by default. But designers don’t usually want to limit themselves to the handful of web-safe fonts.

To use any font beyond web-safe fonts, you have to use *webfonts*. Webfonts are fonts that you load in the browser when the website is loaded. **[Google](https://fonts.google.com/)** provides a set of webfonts that you can use for free; there are also many places where you can buy webfont licenses.

So that your type displays correctly on all devices, it's important to use either a webfont or a web-safe font. This is not an issue for things that are downloaded to a user's device, like mobile apps, because the font files can be included in the download.

# **Summary**

# **Developing your color palette**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to apply color theory to choosing an appropriate color palette for a project.*

In this checkpoint, you'll explore color theory, the meaning of colors, and how to apply colors to your projects.

# **Color theory**

*Color theory* provides guidance for mixing colors and seeks to explain the visual effects created by various color combinations. The color wheel, which you'll learn about next, is made up of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. If you understand how to use color effectively, you can apply it to evoke emotion in users and enhance the usability and success of your designs.

# **Color wheel**

The *color wheel* helps define how colors appear in relation to one another. It depicts the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. You can use the color wheel to define color patterns and schemes.

# **Primary colors**

*Primary colors* are a group of colors that can be mixed or combined to create a range of other colors. The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.

# **Secondary colors**

*Secondary colors* are the result of mixing two primary colors. The secondary colors are green, purple, and orange.

# **Tertiary colors**

*Tertiary colors* fall between primary colors and secondary colors. There are six tertiary colors:

- Yellow-orange (amber)
- Red-orange (vermilion)
- Red-purple (magenta)
- Blue-purple (violet)
- Blue-green (teal)
- Yellow-green (lime green)

# **Warm and cool colors**

Colors can be categorized as warm or cool.

*Warm colors*, which are between red and yellow on the spectrum, are typically associated with fire, heat, and the sun.

*Cool colors* fall between blue and green on the spectrum. Water, sky, and ice are associated with cool colors.

# **Shades, tones, and tints**

The use of *shade*, *tone*, and *tint* creates variations of hues. Tints add touches of white. Tones introduce gray, which is a combination of white and black. Shades are the result of adding black to the original color.

# **Chroma, saturation, and brightness**

*Chroma* refers to the intensity or purity of a hue relative to its brightness. *Saturation* varies based on a scale from white to black. Low saturation occurs when a color is closer to the white side of the spectrum, creating a tint of the original color. This makes it appear duller. High saturation is closer to black; it creates a shade of the original color and makes it more vivid.

# **Color schemes**

# **Complementary**

A *complementary* color scheme is created by using two colors directly opposite each other on the color wheel.

# **Split-complementary**

A *split-complementary* or *compound* color scheme uses three colors. It features a base color and the two colors that are directly next to the base color's complement on the color wheel.

# **Monochromatic**

A *monochromatic* color scheme is created from a single color. It uses shades, tints, and tones to achieve multiple versions of the same hue.

# **Analogous**

An *analogous* color scheme uses colors that are directly next to each other on the color wheel.

# **Color psychology**

Colors have meanings, and they can influence the decisions that users make (and refrain from making). It's important to test your designs so that you can identify the best color for each element. But if you understand the basic psychology behind color, you can predict what might work best.

Red is often associated with danger, fire, urgency, and errors. Orange exudes enthusiasm, attraction, and success. Yellow is associated with sunshine, joy, optimism, and happiness. Green conveys growth, fertility, nature, and harmony. Blue shows faith, stability, calm, and wisdom. Purple emits royalty, creativity, uniqueness, and mystery. White is often related to purity, goodness, and innocence. Black is associated with power, death, and mystery.

# **The importance of color accessibility**

Choosing effective colors for an interface goes far beyond aesthetics. You should make color choices with accessibility in mind; many users have vision disorders that affect the way that they perceive your designs. Color blindness is one of the most common vision impairments among users.

**[Color blindness comes in many forms](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/)**, including the following:

- Red-green color blindness
- Blue-yellow color blindness
- Complete color blindness

Because of this, it's important to understand the implications of your choices when you're designing with color. To help color-impaired users understand key elements and differentiate between the colors that you use, enhance your designs and content with texture, high contrast, and symbols. Using several shades of the same main color can also be helpful.

The **[Colorblind Web Page Filter](http://colorfilter.wickline.org/)** allows you to test a live URL and see if it's accessible for color-impaired users. This tool provides a range of color filters that simulate several types of color blindness; you can enter a URL, select a color filter, and then see how the page would appear to someone with the corresponding type of color blindness.

**[Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/)** is another free tool that can help you design for color-impaired users. It's a desktop app that you can enable when you're designing your mockups or building your sites.

# **Creating your palette**

# 

Color has a huge impact on the memorability of your product. A strong color association with the brand can increase brand awareness and recognition. So, it's important to choose something that makes a memorable statement. That said, if you bring in too many colors or don't balance them well, then your product could look unprofessional. To find the right balance and develop your color intuition, use the following guidelines.

# **Choose one main color**

Most brands have one key color that is associated with their brand. For example, Coke is associated with red, Twitter uses blue, and Vox sticks to yellow.

Selecting your main color gives you a foundation on which to build your palette. It sets the tone for the look and feel of your site.

Establish this color first, before you start thinking about the background and type colors.

# **Where to use your main color**

The *main color* is often part of your logo. As you can see in the previous examples, the main color is used in key places but not everywhere. Use your main color sparingly to draw attention to important information, such as a call to action.

# **Select accent colors**

Use the color wheel to find *accent colors* for each of the different color schemes. This gives you some different options to play with. There are many programs that can help you create a palette of colors. **[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create)**, for example, helps you set a base color and then choose the kind of scheme to use.

Adobe Color was used to create the following examples. In these examples, the bright spring green that's shown on the left is the base color that was used to generate the palettes.

# **Analogous**

# **Monochromatic**

# **Triad**

# **Complementary**

# **Compound, or split-complementary**

When you find some hues that you like, you may want to adjust the saturation to create accent colors that differ in brightness from your main color—especially if your main color is very bright. Having more than one or two bright colors on a page is usually too much and can be harsh on the eyes. So, more muted tones bring balance. Limit yourself to only one or two accent colors.

# **Where to use your accent colors**

Use your accent colors in places that are not the main focal points of the page but that you still want to draw attention to. For example, consider using accent colors on buttons, links, and subheadings.

# **Pick a background color**

The background color serves as the base for your work, much in the same way that your wall color serves as the base for the interior design in your home. Have you ever been in a room where the color was overpowering? Not a comfortable feeling, right? For the same reason, you generally want to be conservative with your background color. Make sure that it isn't too harsh on the eyes.

If your page contains lots of information or images, it's best to go with a white or a neutral background color.

If your page is about advertising a brand, you can consider a bolder color to make a memorable impact.

Either way, you must be conscious of the contrast between your background color and the other elements on the page. Make sure that they are distinguishable.

# **Select your main text color**

You are almost done creating your palette! The last thing that you need to select is the color for your body text. Your body text should usually be black if you have a light-colored background and white if you have a dark background. You may consider revisiting colors that you found while picking your accent colors; try out a very light or very dark shade of those hues.

You should always use a contrast checker to confirm that your background color and text color are legible.

# **Logo and name development**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to sketch and create a digital logo for a project and generate a name for an app.*

In this checkpoint, you'll explore sketching and logo creation. In larger companies with marketing departments, UX and UI designers aren't typically responsible for creating logos from scratch, but it is helpful to know the process. In this course, you'll create a simple logo for your bus app.

# **Generating logo ideas**

Logos can represent an overall brand, a specific product, or both. Mobile apps use logos in the form of an icon. *Mind mapping* and *sketching* are two methods for generating logo ideas quickly.

You can use these methods to ideate and brainstorm visual and verbal concepts to show your stakeholders.

If you find yourself in a creative rut, spin through **[this Company Folders article](http://www.companyfolders.com/blog/200-cool-personal-logo-designs-for-inspiration)** that features 200 personal logos. If you still can't find a way forward, draw the five that you like the most. Just recreate them. The purpose of this exercise isn't to submit one of these as your logo; this is to get rid of the clean, white sheet of paper in front of you that previously was just proof that you couldn't get started. Soon, your ideas will push to the foreground, and you'll be producing your concepts.

At this stage, there's no such thing as a bad idea. Your sketches should be small, quick, and plentiful. Make more than 20 sketches, but fewer than 40. Remember, the more drawings you have, the more comfortable the next step will be.

Before moving forward, you can review the work that you've completed with your stakeholders or client. Validate the strength of your designs and make sure that your top concepts are appropriate.

# **Creating digital drafts**

Once you have selected the top five sketches, create a new document in your favorite digital design app and begin recreating them into vector shapes. (For the purposes of this course, you can use Figma.)

At this point in the program, you may find that you are developing a design style of your own. If so, this is a great time to begin exercising it. But don't fret too much if you don't feel like you're creating something unique to you. The goal is to stretch your ideas in many directions, not invent new ones.

It's good practice to create your original logos using only black. Do this before adding multiple colors to your logo. This approach ensures that your final designs can work across all mediums, in all potential color combinations.

When you're trying to generate your own ideas, it can help a lot to see many examples of the real thing. So make sure to review the additional resources listed at the end of this checkpoint.

# **What's in a name?**

A great product name is key to making your product stand out among a sea of competitors. Some brands are so successful at this that they enter our common vocabulary. To "google something" or to "publish a tweet" was not a thing until Google and Twitter became embedded in the cultural consciousness. Here are some guidelines to help you generate potential product names.

# 

# **Make it relevant**

Choose a name that reflects what it is that your product actually does. Google and Twitter aren't great examples of this. Instead, take inspiration from FreshDirect, a company that delivers fresh groceries to the home of the user, or Headspace, a meditation app. Both of these names have a clear connection to what they do, so they lend themselves well to marketing and memorability. Relevant names are also much more likely to show up in search results.

# **Make it unique**

While relevance is good, you don't want to be too generic. If you scroll through Apple's App Store or the Google Play Store, you'll find tons of apps that all do similar things trying to create a unique name. Many of the names feature a play on words or some other memorable twist, like Pinterest. A long name is not easy to remember; it should ideally be a single word and no more than three. Action words also make especially catchy names.

# **Logo and name development**

Using the best practices you learned in this checkpoint, choose a name for your bus app and create a very simple logo in Figma.

# **Developing high-fidelity prototypes**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to create high-fidelity deliverables.*

# **Key terms**

- High-fidelity prototypes
- Mockups

# **Designing in high-fidelity**

Use this checkpoint to refine your visual design assets and start applying stylistic treatments to your bus app prototype.

Remember that there are a few types of high-fidelity designs, including prototypes and mockups. *High-fidelity prototypes* are typically intended for testing with users; mockups often contain detailed specifications for developers. At this stage of the program, you'll begin creating a high-fidelity prototype that you can use for usability testing. Later, you can use this prototype to inform any *mockups* you create.

# **Simplifying the process by using design components**

There are some excellent design component libraries that you can leverage as a base for your project. You can also create your own design components for your design system library.

Component libraries can be a great starter for your project or library; they can help you save time and let you work with any budget. You can completely customize these components, updating the look and feel to match brand requirements. Review the *Design systems* checkpoint for examples and links to resources.

# **Getting started**

Now, you're going to lay out the visual design of your wireframes and bring some pixel magic to life. Here are some tips:

- If you are working with a design library or system, review the components so that you know what you have available.
- You may want to start with one of the more creative screens, or you may want to dive in and handle the easiest first. (When you work for a client or project team, you'll likely be assigned a specific set of pages for initial delivery.)
- The first thing that you'll want to do is establish order and structure for your design.
- Think about the viewport that you're designing for.
- Lay out the grid to support your design.
- When you create your design layout, name your layers and define any symbols, styles, and components.

# 

# **Assignment**

# **Creating a high-fidelity prototype**

Using Figma or a tool of your choice, create a high-fidelity version of your bus app prototype. (It is recommended that you make a copy of your existing file. Keep two files so that you have evidence of your earlier choices. You can show these as separate steps when you work on your case study and portfolio later in the program.) Follow these steps:

- Review the deliverables you've created in previous checkpoints.
- Incorporate the branding specifications you've created—including the logotype, typographic choices, and colors.
- You may find that you need to tweak some of your choices once they have been put all together. Be sure to update your guides if you make any changes.

### The best way to receive feedback from mentors about your high-fidelity mockups is to submit a file that they can leave comments in. It's important that these comments are preserved so that subsequent mentors can view the revisions that have been requested of you. When you receive feedback, duplicate your designs into a new file or page (in Figma or other software) and edit the new version. Don't resolve comments once you've addressed them. That way, you're preserving the iterations as well as the feedback. Be sure to label the previous version's page or file descriptively, using the format *Version 1—[date]*. Label the new page or file that you want reviewed *Latest version—grade this one*.

# **Introduction to the deliver phase**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to describe the overall work to be done in the deliver phase.*

The *deliver phase* is the culmination of the discover, define, and develop phases. It marks the beginning of the end of the project.

The deliver phase introduces a period of support, tests, and iterations, all in the name of achieving the desired product experience and user satisfaction. Your role as a designer is to ensure that the company looks outside of itself when creating a product. This ensures that the product is created with the user in mind, which results in a better product.

# **Get started**

In this checkpoint, you'll explore the deliver phase of the design process. Your project work in the deliver phase focuses on testing the *usability* of your bus app, as well as refining the product you're creating.

# **Focus on the deliver phase**

During the discover and define phases of the program, you prepared yourself with foundational research and documentation. During the develop phase, you refined your ideas with a focus on UI and visual design. In the deliver phase, you'll focus on testing out all of your work so far through *usability testing*. You'll also learn how to package your assets for delivery to the development teams.

The goal of the delivery phase is to bring the product out of *ideation* and into reality. In real-world contexts, this process can be quite messy, as designers are continually iterating throughout the process. This process is illustrated in the following overview of the delivery phase.

The delivery phase is split into equal parts: *support* (management and client alignment) and *production* (ongoing support through testing and *iteration*). From a process perspective, the delivery phase entails several steps.

# **Planning**

*Planning* is the initial stage of the delivery process. A good plan sets the work in motion and tackles questions like, "What requirements are needed for this product to come to life?" Planning generally involves the entire team, including product managers, business managers, the design team, and the technical team. You will all want to be on the same page about user needs, wire flow, business goals, and timelines before creating any tangible work.

- **Key stakeholders**: product manager, business manager, technical team, and design team
- **Deliverables**: project plan

# **Implementation**

Remember all of those design deliverables that you created for your bus app? In real-world scenarios, you would share those with a technical team. You and the technical team would work together to build the interface, implement the style guide, and ensure that the features you designed are working correctly.

- **Key stakeholders**: design team and technical team
- **Deliverables**: UI elements, style guide, features, and prototypes

# **Usability testing**

It's critical to continue to test the product during the delivery phase. Of course, tests often happen during any stage in a product's life. Because the app is more developed, at this point you can collect user feedback on the app's full functionality and usability.

You can construct two major types of usability tests:

**Comparative**: Also known as A/B testing, *comparative testing* helps test different versions of an app to decide which direction to further develop it. For comparative testing, you'll measure the participants' performance—how well they're able to complete tasks—record errors that occur, and note where participants become confused. The goal of comparative testing is to gain greater insight into design elements and layouts that work well and those that cause problems.

**Explorative**: The goal of these tests is to discover ways to improve the product, often making sure the UI is consistent, clean, and well-structured. *Explorative tests* help identify potential usability issues and development bugs, highlight assumptions and questions for further research, and help a team empathize with the user.

- **Key stakeholders**: design team
- **Deliverables**: user insights, UI audit, and wire flow audit

# **Usability evaluation**

In this stage, you can make your suggestions or next steps for the team to take. To begin *evaluation*, you must first define what you're looking for. Review your original goals for the tests and remind yourself of the pain points that you wanted to evaluate.

- **Key stakeholders**: design team and product manager
- **Deliverables**: usability report

# **Iteration**

Once you have agreement from everyone on the team regarding the usability issues to tackle, you can begin iterating on your design.

*Image source*: **[Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com/customers/iterative-design-process-at-tokbox/)**

The phrase *test early and often* comes into play during this stage—once you make a change, you'll have to test your designs all over again. Remember to stay motivated during this stage. Although the work can seem tedious, it's worth creating a product that users find satisfaction in using.

- **Key stakeholders**: product manager, design team, and technical team
- **Deliverables**: integrated feedback and revised prototypes

# **Launch**

The *launch phase* is the last step in the delivery phase and is an incredibly satisfying moment for a team. After many iterations and tests, this is when everyone's hard work culminates in a beautifully designed and intuitively functioning product.

- **Key stakeholders**: product manager, design team, technical team, and business manager
- **Deliverables**: finished product

# **Continuous delivery**

If you are an in-house designer, you're required to monitor the analytics of the product to ensure that it is satisfying user needs and business goals. You might be tasked to create more usability tests, gather focus groups, conduct ethnographic studies, and create more iterations.

To remain relevant, products should adapt to how human behaviors grow and change over time. The following graphic illustrates the cycle of *continuous delivery*.

*Image source*: **[ITPro Today](https://www.itprotoday.com/devops-and-software-development/continuous-delivery-foundation-sets-cicd-path-2020)**

- **Key stakeholders**: product manager, business manager, technical team, and design team
- **Deliverables**: user feedback, evaluation reports, and finished product

There you have it—the delivery phase broken down into a clear process. Later in this checkpoint, you'll dive deeper into the delivery process. You'll also explore deliverables specific to the design delivery phase and your bus project.

# **A closer look at deliverables in the deliver phase**

By now you've already created design assets and deliverables for your bus project. In the deliver phase, you'll refine what you've created and will create additional deliverables.

# **Project plan**

Before you create any work in the delivery phase, it's best to have a *project plan* in place. A project plan is a brief summary of the work you intend to create, a list of activities you intend to do—often testing, building, and releasing—and a list of the outputs you plan to create. This plan is important for the client—and you—to quickly assess whether you have interpreted the project in the same way.

# **User flow**

In previous weeks, you created a *user flow* for your bus project. In real-world delivery phases, teams typically revisit user flows to ensure that all paths a user can take are intuitive. After usability tests, it's possible that you'll need to rework and iterate upon flows to create a more satisfying path for users.

# **Wireframes**

You are also familiar with *wireframes* as low-fidelity screens without visual styles or branded elements. Wireframes can be tested to quickly validate the layout of design elements.

Depending on what you're testing—layout or placement of elements—you may be running tests with a small handful of people, perhaps three or four. After usability tests, you might need to iterate on wireframes multiple times so that they meet user needs and business goals.

# **Wire flow**

A *wire flow* is similar to a user flow in that it documents the paths that a user can take. Instead of shapes and text, a wire flow is a set of corresponding screens along a path, or the interactions that each screen provides for the user to meet a need. Screens usually connect interactive elements with a red line leading to another screen.

# **Prototypes**

You know by now that *prototypes* come in a variety of mediums: sketches, paper prototypes, low-fidelity wireframes, coded, and clickable or interactive. In real-world scenarios, you might test a variety of prototypes at varying levels of fidelity. Here, you'll test your high-fidelity prototype.

# **Mockups**

The last production step is to turn your final designs into *mockups* for the development team and the client team. Mockups, like wireframes, are full-scale *static images* of each screen in an application. They are typically fully branded and include written content, images, and icons.

Mockups are useful for getting a sense of the app's look and feel. Do the colors seem right? Does the content make sense? How about the icons? In the delivery phase, mockups are reviewed by the team before presenting them—in pixel-perfect condition—to the client.

# **UI elements**

You are familiar with *UI elements*, as you learned about them when creating style guides. Later, you'll learn about the process of slicing and exporting UI elements. For now, UI elements in the delivery phase supply the app's visual design and branding.

During heavy rounds of testing, UI elements may shift around or change color to support the app's usability. It's best to stay detached from your designs, as your job as a designer is to create the optimal design for the people using the app.

# **UI library**

While you're finalizing and polishing the app, you'll be asked to create a *UI library* for each branded element and their visual changes at different states. For example, an active button would look different when the pointer is held over it or when disabled.

You'll need to make these buttons and record their hex codes, font size, and font style (bold, italic, or regular). This deliverable can be a living document as a web page or saved as a PDF file.

# **Usability report**

A *usability report* is dependent on user insights and feedback, which drive the strategy and motivation for improving the app. Usability reports come in two forms: a multipage document or a presentation. Later checkpoints will explore usability reports in more detail.

# **Who gets what?**

Now that you're familiar with the deliverables in this phase, you might wonder who receives what. When you're working on a team, it makes sense for deliverables to go to their intended group so that the work progresses faster. The following chart depicts an accurate representation of this process.

*Image source*: **[Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/common-ux-deliverables/)**

This chart can be split into two groups: internal and external. The internal group includes managers, developers, the design team, and CEOs and other C-level roles. The external group generally includes clients or other stakeholders outside the company. During the delivery phase, you'll present most of your work internally.

# **Your relationship to your team**

So far, you've learned a little about how teams work. However, you may not yet understand the context of your role or your relationships with your teammates. The *Team design* modules will take you on a deeper dive into teams and working within teams. To keep you informed, a brief overview follows.

# **Product or project manager**

The product or project manager is the person you'll be in most direct communication with. Their role is to oversee the product's development from beginning to end and to manage that process.

They deal in deliverables and milestones, and they make adjustments to the calendar as needed. They have extensive knowledge of how the product works, and they communicate with you the stakeholders' vision for the product. Managers also handle all communications between teams and report to C-level stakeholders.

# **Stakeholders**

*Stakeholders* is a term for someone who has an interest in the product. More broadly, stakeholders are investors, C-level personnel (such as the chief executive officer and chief technology officer), customers, and external clients. They can contribute to the vision of the product and regularly check the product's progression. As a UX designer, you're required to attend meetings with stakeholders.

# **Design team**

In larger companies, a *design team* usually consists of a user researcher, visual designer, frontend designer, and user experience designer (you!). The design team works together according to the product's stage.

A user researcher is needed for the discover and define stages (defining user needs). A visual designer, frontend designer, and user experience designer are needed for the later stages that focus on prototypes and mockups.

# **Developer or technical team**

Aside from your design team and your manager, you'll work closely with the development or technical team as they code the product. During the development stage, it's best if members of the design and technical teams sit close together. This arrangement lets them answer questions, go over wire flows, and ensure that the design is being coded according to the design team's standards.

This proximity builds stronger bonds between teammates, letting them help each other to create better solutions for the product. You'll also learn each other's language to better communicate ideas.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you explored the process of the delivery phase. You learned that there are a handful of deliverables created during this phase, adding to the growing number of deliverables you created during the earlier phases. Following is a combined list of deliverables:

1. Project plan
2. User flow
3. Wireframes
4. Wire flow
5. Prototypes
6. UI elements
7. UI library
8. Features
9. Usability report

The production of an app from conception to reality is an enormous undertaking that requires the expertise of many people. A good product is the mark of a good team, and working within a team is an experience that can't be replicated.

You're now more aware of what it takes to create great products, and you're also more equipped to drive your ideas forward. Good luck on your journey!

# **Refine your prototype**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to refine your clickable prototype for your bus project.*

You have come a long way in your bus app project! This checkpoint is designed to help you get your current prototype ready for usability testing. Your assignment is to refine your deliverables as you see fit.

# **Prototypes: A review**

*Prototypes* are a draft of a product that's ready to undergo testing until it is ready to launch. This very important step comes in a variety of shapes and formats. The goal is to present the prototype to potential users—which are based on personas—for *usability testing*. You'll get into testing in the next checkpoint, but for now you'll focus on the importance of prototypes. You'll also focus on how to choose your prototypes depending on the usability test that you'll conduct.

For the purposes of this checkpoint, you'll work on a *clickable prototype*. Clickable prototypes are created to observe how a product or application works and how users should interact with it. A clickable prototype is different than a sketch, wireframe, and mockup because their interactivity promotes them to a simulation of how a product works.

You'll use prototypes to accomplish several goals:

1. Improve the user experience
2. Test performance and features
3. Save money during the development of the product

You may be wondering why the third item—saving money—is included. In addition to solving users' practical problems, part of a designer's responsibility is to create within a budget. It takes time and money (usually someone else's) to bring a new product to life, and a financial plan is one of the first elements to work out.

# **Benefits of clickable or interactive prototypes**

Clickable prototypes act like working models of the finalized product. You can test for a variety of subjects: layout, functionality, usability, animation, and visual design.

These *interactive prototypes* make the development phase of the app easier because your developers can see how the app would function and how to code it. If you have the time and resources, creating a clickable prototype can save you headaches when working on numerous product iterations.

# **Areas you can consider when refining your prototype**

There are some common elements to consider adding to your bus app user flows and prototypes if you haven't already. This checkpoint explores a few of these elements. Before adding anything to your prototype, consider what makes the most sense for your project scope.

# **Onboarding**

*Onboarding* refers to a user's introduction to the application. Onboarding typically consists of a simple tutorial that guides a first-time user through an app.

Designers have learned to make this interaction fun and exciting by introducing branding elements and animation into the form. **[View this video of Flipboard's onboarding process](https://youtu.be/U_jCwureQog)** to gather inspiration for your project's onboarding (note that the onboarding process stops around 1:00 into the video).

# **Navigation models**

Thousands of applications are created every day. Each interface requires a *navigation model*, which lets users locate content and features. Most apps with robust features use a menu icon to indicate navigation. This is visually represented as three horizontal lines or dots, like a ☰ or a ፧, that, when tapped, bring up a menu in either a separate page, a card pop-up, or a drop-down. After users click to open up the navigation panel, the horizontal lines (which are also known as a *hamburger*) are sometimes animated as an X icon to indicate closing the menu.

Smaller apps with fewer features may only need to provide a few navigational controls. These apps often show controls on a bar or panel at the very bottom of the screen.

There are many patterns available to help you refine navigation. Check out the resource **[UI Patterns: Navigation](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/navigation/list)** to determine which model best fits your design.

# **Data input**

For applications to work as intended, most require some sort of *data input* from the user: email addresses, passwords, and sometimes additional contact information. As a best practice, it's helpful to provide both clear prompts and clear feedback whenever a user enters data.

For example, if a person enters an email address, the system usually validates the email address or lets the user know that they didn't enter a valid one. If a person enters an address in a valid format, the UI might surface a green check. If the format isn't valid, the UI might show an alert message prompting the person to reenter their email address.

You can read more about gathering data from inputs at **[UI Patterns: Getting Input](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/getting-input/list)**.

# **Best practices for animation**

As there are best practices for interfaces, you'll also use best practices for animation of an icon or interaction. If you animate the logo or a specific branding element that's meant to visually stimulate the user, then you'll have full creative license over that element. For common icons, however, there are animation best practices to consider when creating your clickable prototype.

# **Dan Saffer: The six goals of using animation**

Dan Saffer is a product design thought leader and author who has written several books on design. The following list is quoted from **[Microinteractions](https://www.amazon.com/Microinteractions-Full-Color-Designing-Details/dp/1491945923/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=o%27reilly+books+microinteractions&qid=1578421211&sr=8-1)**.

1. Focus user attention in the appropriate place.
2. Show relationships between objects and their actions.
3. Maintain context during transitions between views or object states.
4. Provide the perception of progression or activity.
5. Create a virtual space that helps guide users from state to state and function to function.
6. Encourage immersion and further engagement.

It's important to note that if your interaction already works seamlessly without animation, it might be best not to add any. The effectiveness of animation may decrease when met with differently abled people, and it may serve as a distraction as opposed to helping.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you learned about different ways to refine your prototypes. Remember that you don't have to reinvent the wheel when creating your products. Being a designer gives you access to vast amounts of research conducted regarding human behaviors and habits. You can use these resources to strengthen your work.

# **Usability tests**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will know how to test your clickable prototype for usability.*

It's time to prepare for usability testing. Now that you have a clickable prototype, you can use it in your testing and *iteration* rounds.

To begin testing, you need to decide what to test for and how you can measure success. From there, you can map out the goals of the test and discuss what areas of the product you want to evaluate. The primary purpose of *usability testing* is to improve the design—its functionality, usability, and even its visual design if there are design elements preventing users from meeting their own goals.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll run a qualitative usability test with two to five participants, using your bus app prototype.

# **Qualitative usability testing**

At this stage of the program, you'll conduct a *qualitative usability test*. *Qualitative data* gathers observational insight that identifies the ease of use of its features and UI. This data is best gathered by providing real-life scenarios and believable tasks that the *participant* undergoes through testing.

# **Qualitative research**

*Qualitative research* provides data that determines which parts of an interface work well. It focuses on the participants' experience and perspective of the interface.

Typically, you'll observe users as they carry out realistic tasks in a believable scenario. You'll focus on the paths (or *flows*) that users take to achieve their goals. You'll want to document the comments they make and the problems they experience when navigating the UI.

This feedback helps you determine whether to change the course of the study to gain more insight into their specific problem areas. Depending on other participants in the study and what they encounter, you may determine whether the UI is poorly designed or not.

# **Usability testing process**

To explore how to conduct usability tests, you need to gather information to determine why you're conducting a test. You'll define the participants and their characteristics, what kind of actions and features the test should cover, and what you hope to learn from this test. Finally, you'll map out the timeline.

# **Elements of a plan**

Usually, you'll meet with the product manager and other designers on your team to develop a *plan* of action. In your career, you'll create a draft of a plan and circulate it to the entire team. Your team will then give you feedback and make suggestions.

# **Scope**

The *scope* documents what you are testing and what aspects of the product will be tested. Are you testing a checkout flow? Are you testing the layout of products for an e-commerce store? You should be as specific as possible, such as labeling the product as of a specific date.

# **Purpose**

Why are you conducting this test? As you define the *purpose*, you can outline the concerns, questions, and goals for the test. As you go through your iteration rounds, you'll have several areas of concern. Your concerns should drive the scenarios you'll create.

# **Schedule and location**

When and where are you going to conduct the test? How many sessions will you hold in a day and at what times? If you don't have a location ready, you'll have to figure that out first and then move forward with scheduling.

# **Sessions**

You'll want to provide a description of the *sessions* and be as specific as possible. A typical session lasts between 30 and 90 minutes, so you'll want to figure out when you'll test the participants.

You'll also want to leave some time between each session so you can gather and organize your data, reset the environment, and review the session. Keep in mind that some participants may also be running late, so you'll need a buffer for the process to run smoothly.

# **Equipment**

Indicate the type of *equipment* you plan to use in the test, such as laptops, phones, and paper prototypes. Indicate whether you'll be video or audio recording or using special accessibility tools.

# **Participants**

Indicate the number of participants to be tested as well as how you plan to recruit them.

# **Choosing your ideal participants**

Before you begin testing, you'll want to seek out the *ideal participants* for your test. An ideal participant is someone who matches the personas that you created during the define phase.

The ideal number depends on exactly what you're testing and how many times. Because this number varies between projects, for your bus project you will seek out three to five participants. Once you've found them, you'll want to create a contract or nondisclosure agreement (NDA) and have your participants sign it before any testing begins.

You've learned that contracts and NDAs work in everyone's favor and keep you protected. For the sake of testing, a contract is important to have in place so that participants know what they are being tested for, as well as their compensation. The contract also gets each participant's permission for you to observe, film, or record them. If you don't have their permission, you don't have permission to use their results.

# **Thoughtful facilitation**

Before talking to your participants, you'll want to create a moderator's guide or script so that the information you provide is consistent throughout each iteration of your test. This script also serves as a reminder to provide paperwork. It also lets your participants know that their performance will not be judged as good or bad.

# **Best practices: Scenarios and tasks**

The most valuable usability tests guide users through meaningful scenarios and tasks. *Scenarios* provide motivation and context for the participant to complete the set of tasks required in the test. *Tasks*, on the other hand, are the activities to be carried out within a scenario. Scenarios and tasks should be adjusted to meet the goals of the usability test.

Like many aspects of the design process, there are also *best practices* for creating scenarios and tasks. It's a good idea to keep the following guidelines in mind.

1. **Create a short, believable scenario**. If your scenario is very long and complex, you may consider breaking it up into two or three scenarios.
2. **Scenarios should tell a story that motivates your users**. Why would they want to use your product in the first place?
3. **Effective tasks contain scenario information**. It's best to write a story surrounding the task. For example, you could write, "You are looking for a filter for the lens on your camera. You simply want to block out UV light, but there are a variety of options to choose from. Purchase a filter that's within your budget of $150."
4. **Write tasks that the participant expects to do**. Remember that tasks and scenarios need to be believable to be successful.
5. **Identify specific activities that represent typical tasks that your participants would perform**. These tasks should always relate to the test's goals.
6. **Don't lead the participant in the direction you want**. This introduces *bias* and *skews* the results of the test. You want to test the app's usability, which you can only do by observing how the participant achieves their tasks.
7. **Don't write tasks dependent on each other for the participant to move on**. This also skews the results. You can't be completely sure that the participant will have the same process as the app's creators.

# **Measuring success**

Your next step is *measuring success*. How will you know that your usability test is successful? You can look at how often a participant achieved their task, making usability the bottom line for testing.

Depending on the test, you'll evaluate other metrics that you and the stakeholders have determined and documented in your plan. Following are a few common metrics that you can keep in mind.

- Time taken to finish the task
- How many errors each participant makes
- Learnability of the interface
- Participant satisfaction when interacting with the product
- How many mouse clicks or taps it takes the participant to achieve the task
- How many issues arise
- Measuring how often a participant detours from the optimal path

There isn't a guiding principle or any metrics that one should always test for. Because projects differ in so many ways, feel free to create your own goals. Determine for yourself what's important for the user to feel satisfied, and define success with that goal in mind.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you learned about the process of qualitative usability testing, including how to create a usability test with meaningful tasks and scenarios.

# **Resources**

If you feel nervous talking to people, don't worry! Everyone has been there before, and it really helps to create a script. Check out the following resource for a sample usability testing script that you can tweak.

# **Usability reports**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will know how to create usability reports and communicate findings to stakeholders.*

In the previous checkpoint, you conducted a *usability test*. In this checkpoint, you'll learn about usability report structure and have the option of creating one yourself.

# **Usability reports: The big picture**

A *usability report* contains information that summarizes what you learned during the usability test. Usability reports often include information about the paths people took to accomplish their tasks and any challenges they had along the way. In addition, reports contain your recommendations for enhancing the design.

Reports may come in two formats: *documents* or *presentations*.

# **Report documents**

Some workplaces may ask you to create a written report. Elements included in this document include a table of contents, introduction, methodology, participants, results from tasks, and recommendations for next steps. For a more visual example, you can explore a usability report template and use it for future reports.

# **Presentations**

In place of a multipage document, the other option is to create a presentation of your findings. To see what this could look like, check out **[this example](https://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/usability-testing-report-template)** from Usability.gov.

In real-world contexts, your team expects to receive a report at the end of the *testing phase*. If you've taken a look at the provided examples, you may feel overwhelmed. Don't worry! You'll be able to walk through how to organize your data. You can also explore the step-by-step process of writing successful usability reports.

# **Organizing your notes and analyzing findings**

After you have collected data through usability testing, it's time to organize it! To make things easier, you can place your notes into *categories* that reference the type of tasks that participants took, such as using the search bar, adding items to the cart, or scheduling an appointment.

You'll also want to start organizing your data into three main categories: *issues* encountered, *actions* taken, and *comments* made. You can add helpful location-related subcategories or tags to these insights. For example, if Sheila's payment failed to go through, the tag for this issue would be "checkout page."

Another way to summarize your findings from each participant is to use a *feedback capture grid*, such as the one shown in the following image.

After analyzing your data, you'll be able to draw conclusions about the usability of your product. It's best if you can categorize the issues as *critical*, *serious*, or *minor*. That way, you'll know what to start working on when you begin the iteration phase.

# **Creating a usability report**

Now that you've evaluated your data, you can create a report that explains what you've learned. This report also advocates for any changes to improve your product's usability.

Your report should showcase the highest-priority issues, be specific, include evidence, present solutions, and include positive findings. Following are a few tips to help you create a usability report.

# **Contents**

Most usability reports include the following types of information. The report is organized to support a conversation with a team. Here's a common structure you'll see in usability reports.

- **Summary**: A brief summary of the test contains the scope, purpose, teammates and their roles, schedule and location of the tests, and equipment used or tested.
- **Sessions**: You'll want to include a summary of each session that took place. You'll also want to note some issues or errors that you noticed occur.
- **Participants**: Reports typically include a section to let stakeholders know how many participants were tested and what market segment they represented. Either in this section or elsewhere in the report, you can include noteworthy quotes or comments about what the participants liked, desired, and imagined. A good example of displaying this information is to use an *I Like, I Wish, What If* chart.

- **Findings or results**: Usability reports often list specific *findings*. What was problematic in the design? What worked well? Findings are statements that explain user behaviors in connection to a design issue. Here's an example: "Participants struggled to find the button [behavior] because the color contrast was too low [design issue]."
- **Next steps or recommendations**: After analyzing all of your data, you'll want to present the next steps to your team. Remember that you are an advocate for your product and that the core goal for a usability test is to improve the design. Recommend what aspect of the design should change, and back up your pitch with specific data points from your test.

# **Tailoring reports to nondesigners**

As you present to more and more people, you'll quickly realize that not everyone knows design lingo. You'll have to tailor your reports to include language that every role can resonate with. Following is a list of common terms that you can use in a roomful of diverse skill sets.

# **External clients**

- **Return on investment (ROI)**: The efficiency of an investment
- **Business-to-business (B2B)**: Commerce transactions between businesses
- **Business-to-consumer (B2C)**: The sale of goods and services from businesses to the end user
- **Profit margin**: A ratio of profitability calculated by finding the net profit as a percentage of revenue
- **Net profit**: Gross revenue minus all expenses
- **Liabilities**: Debts and obligations the business owes to others

# **Developers**

- **Application program interface (API)**: How computers and applications communicate with each other
- **Attribute**: Information about elements of a component in your design
- **Backend**: Behind-the-scenes code, styles, and plugins that keep the frontend of a website running
- **Call to action (CTA)**: The buttons or interactions that drive certain conversions
- **Frontend**: The visuals of a website, also known as the design that users see

# **What comes next?**

After delivering your presentation, you'll want to integrate your recommendations into your designs. If you're working within a team, instead of moving forward into the *iteration phase*, you'll want to hold a meeting regarding what to prioritize. One way to do that is by holding a *brainstorming session* about the product's vision.

# **Brainstorming session**

Perhaps one of the most important steps after you present your results is to hold a brainstorming session. This is a great follow-up activity because the entire team can assess what to work on next, as well as their goals.

# **Integrate and iterate**

Once everyone agrees on the next steps, you can begin working on your next iteration. Open up your prototyping application and use your findings to improve the design. Remember to rename your initial prototype so you can keep *archived versions* of your work. This is called *version control*, which helps you visually confirm what changes you created and what aspects of the app you tested.

An example of this file-naming framework is to include the date **(YYYY/MM/DD)**, an underscore to act as a space, the name of the flow, and a *v* for version. Take a look at the following examples to see the framework in action:

- **2020-01-15_Onboarding_v1** is the first iteration
- **2020-01-15_Onboarding_v2** is the second iteration
- **2020-01-15_Onboarding_FINAL** is the final deliverable

In working situations, you might encounter instances like **2020-01-15_Onboarding_FINALv5**. However, you'll want to refrain from labeling anything as final if it hasn't been signed off by someone with the authority to approve the design, like the product manager. For a project to be signed off means that it has been approved to move to the next step.

When iterating on the design, keep in mind that you must only change what you were testing for. If you change other aspects of your product while you're at it, you might introduce new design flaws.

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you learned how to create a usability report. You know that you can either create a presentation with accompanying documents, or you can create a traditional written report.

This checkpoint also introduced you to key terms that every product designer should know when advocating for your app to nondesigners. You've worked toward a well-rounded education, and you're well on your way to becoming a great designer. Next, you'll learn how to prepare and deliver your final design elements.

# **Delivering assets**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will discover how to deliver design elements like logos, icons, and fonts. In addition, this checkpoint provides tips for asset organization.*

In this checkpoint, you will focus on the design *assets* (or *elements*) of your bus interface. This means that you'll learn the best practices for exporting your logo, icons, content, and other visual elements that make up your app.

# **Best practices for organizing your elements**

If you don't have any idea how to start organizing your product, here are a few tips:

- **Name your elements**. This is especially important for pages and *artboards*. In most apps, you can change the names of your artboard by double-clicking them in the left submenu.
- **Group your elements**. By *grouping* sections of a design, you can create a hierarchy in your system. If your design has a navigational menu, you'll want to separate the navigation from the rest of the content. Select all of the layers (and elements) that make up the menu by holding down the **Shift** key and clicing on each layer. Then right-click and select **Group Layers** from the pop-up menu. From here, you can be as thorough as possible by grouping elements together and renaming them.
- **Create groups for each overarching content category**. These categories include **Navigation**, **Home**, and **User Profile**, depending on the product you're creating. The elements that make up these categories are often text, buttons, and images.

# **Exporting sizes**

Hardware has gotten better, resulting in larger screen dimensions for computers and mobile phones. This means that the elements that you *export* have to accommodate these larger screens. You'll want to make sure that the elements you're exporting are correctly specified for the devices that your app will live on.

A standard display has a 1:1 pixel density (or *@1x*), where one pixel is equal to one point. Higher-resolution displays have a higher pixel density scaling from 2 to 3 (referred to as *@2x* and *@3x*, or 200px and 300px). As a result, higher-resolution displays ask for images with more pixels.

# **Design specs**

Design *specs*, or *specifications*, are a form of communication between designers and developers. Design specs are detailed documents providing UI design details—like measurements, spacing, and colors—wire flows, behaviors, and functionality. A developer uses this document to build the product to the designer's specs.

# **Delivering your assets**

Now that you have some best practices up your sleeve for creating pixel-perfect UI, you'll want to know how to export them and in what format.

# **Per screen**

If you're working on an Apple device, that device is most likely outfitted with a *Retina* screen, which is a brand name trademarked by Apple. Although there are no standard sizes for displays, the most common are 720, 1080, 1440, 2K, and 4K *pixels per inch (PPI)*.

# **Per format**

You will want to export your assets in these two formats: *PNG* and *SVG*. Assets can be elements, as you've seen, but they can also be whole screens or artboards. Different devices require a specific format for each type of screen resolution.

# **PNG format**

- **Design**: If you want to export one of your screens, you can save it at 1x resolution. This option is appropriate if you want a couple of screens to present to stakeholders.
- **Web**: For an accurate *web display*, assets are usually exported at 1x and 2x resolutions.
- **iOS**: For iOS screens, assets are exported at 1x, 2x, and 3x resolutions.
- **Android**: For Android screens, you can export assets at 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, and 4x resolutions to accommodate the large variety of devices running on Android.

# **SVG format**

SVG is a widely used format for icons or other vector assets to scale on different resolution screens without losing image quality. When exporting assets, you'll want to export in both PNG and SVG formats to account for responsive designs.

# **Launching an app**

Suppose you're in the final phases of the product development phase. Once you've exported all of your assets and handed off your design specs to your developers, the next step is to wait until your app launches.

This is one of the most exciting times in a designer's career. Launching an app means that you did all the hard work of conceptualizing, designing, testing, and developing an idea from a seedling all the way to fruition. It's an exciting milestone and definitely one to celebrate.

Congratulations! You did it!

# **Summary**

In this checkpoint, you explored the best practices for creating an organized system for your bus product. You are aware that you can rename artboards and group related elements together to create structure and make the exporting process simpler.

# **Writing a case study**

Learning objective: *By the end of the checkpoint, you will be able to draft a case study for your portfolio, demonstrating your design process and thinking.*

Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the delivery phase. In this checkpoint, you'll learn how to present your work through a portfolio case study.

# **Case studies: The big picture**

A *case study* is a document, typically in your design portfolio, that outlines the actions you took to complete a project. Your case study helps you articulate your design decisions.

When you apply for a UX or UI role, recruiters typically ask for a link to your *online portfolio*. Your online portfolio is a website that includes two to three case studies of your best or most recent work.

When you are interviewing for a UX or UI role, most hiring managers will ask you to walk them through one or two case studies. Your case studies help them assess how you think through design challenges and approach the *design process*. They'll also want to see examples of your work.

Case studies are useful because they let you highlight your thinking and logic. They prove that you can think through a challenge and do more than just produce design deliverables. Case studies differentiate you from the next designer because they show that you can communicate about UX.

# **Planning ahead: Drafting a case study for your bus app**

Later in this program, you will build an online portfolio where you can showcase all of your work.

At this stage, you should draft a case study for your bus app while your memory is still fresh. You can complete this draft in a simple Google Doc.

# **What to include in your case studies**

Hiring managers expect to see case studies in a standard format. Most case studies include the following information about a project:

1. Overview
2. Problem statement
3. Users and audience
4. Roles and responsibilities
5. Scope and constraints
6. Process and what you did
7. Outcomes and results

The following chart offers a structure that you can use to draft the case study for your bus app.

# **The writing process**

The following steps outline a process that you can follow to write your case study.

# **Create a project title**

Create a meaningful project title that references the type of product you worked on, as well as the company it was for. You can use the following format for your titles.

> GAP Website Redesign to Improve User Experience or Company | Responsibility | Impact
> 

When recruiters view your portfolio, they'll know exactly what the project is about. Avoid titling your projects by the company name, because that alone might not provide enough information.

# **Write an outline**

The purpose of starting with an outline is to help you decide what to include in the case study. In the event that you had multiple responsibilities throughout the project, you may be able to create more case studies from that single project.

You can easily create an outline by addressing each of the seven listed items that identify what to include in your case studies.

# **Fill in the details**

Once you have an outline, you can ask yourself these questions to fill out the *Process and what you did* section.

- What methods did you use?
- Why did you choose those methods?
- What were your results?
- Did you achieve your goals?
- What did you learn?

You'll want to practice fleshing this section out. A good evaluation of the project contains an in-depth look at what types of data (qualitative and quantitative) you looked to gain, observations, and conclusions about what you did. A good example of an evaluation would be:

> "To evaluate the new checkout on the Home Depot mobile app, we relied on usage metrics in conjunction with 8 usability tests. This allowed us to gain deeper understanding through combining both qualitative and quantitative information. Although users were able to get through the checkout more quickly, they continued to struggle with the shipping section. Discussions with users discussion revealed that often times, products in one order have different shipping addresses, which was possible, but difficult in the current checkout."From Inside Design by InVision
> 

# **Edit your case study**

You can make your case study as succinct as possible by doing another round of editing for each section. However, you'll want to keep the *Process and what you did* section as thorough as possible. Start by taking everything you've written for each section and summarize it into 140 characters. This ensures that you're presenting the most important information relating to the project.

# **Add the case study to your portfolio**

When you're ready, you can add your case study to your portfolio. Depending on how you format your portfolio, you may decide to remove some sections of your case study for an image that better reflects your vision and message. Later on, you'll be guided through creating your portfolio, so just hold on to your work for now. Following are three examples of portfolios that you can check out.

Following are examples of excellent case studies.

- **[User Research & Redesign of the Rider App](http://simonpan.com/work/uber/)** for Uber by Simon Pan
- **[User Research & Onboarding for Le Tote](http://helenwbentley.com/lt-onboarding)** by Helen Bentley
- **[Interaction Design for finding optimal work commutes](https://www.mukinoy.ca/)** with Ways to Go to Work by Yasmin MukinoFollowing are a couple of resources to help you create great case studies.

# **Preparing a presentation**

Learning objective: *By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to present your work persuasively and confidently.*

# **Overview and purpose**

On the job, you usually won't just submit your deliverables and be done with the project. You'll likely need to present your work to a broader team and provide context for how you arrived at your solution. Presentation skills are an important asset on the job to make sure everyone understands the incredible work you have done!

This checkpoint prepares you for your live assessment, in which you'll present the work you've completed over the course of your bus project.

# **Preparing to present your work**

There's some great news for you⁠—in the previous checkpoints, you have already written a lot of great material that can help you prepare for your presentation. The case studies you outlined in the previous checkpoint are of particular use.

Your presentation should tell the story of your project's journey. That means reflecting on the phases of the design process, as well as pulling out succinct takeaways and important information to help your audience understand what led to the final product.

Following is a list of questions you can use to help your reflection, but don't limit yourself to this list. Instead, use it to inspire you to identify what *you* think is most important to share with your audience.

- What precisely is the problem?
- What are the goals of the product?
- What user testing was conducted, and what did you learn?
- Why did you choose to implement this the way you did?
- How does your product solve the original problem?

# **Presentation materials**

You aren't required to prepare any specific materials to present with. You should choose what works best for you and your presentation style. Following are a few examples of items that people might prepare.

- An outline of the presentation
- Abbreviated speaker notes
- Visuals (including a slide deck)
- Anything that helps you organize your thoughts in a logical and easy-to-follow way

# **Slide deck best practices**

Creating a slide deck is *not required*. However, because slide decks are a common presentation tool and can be frequently misused, here are some guidelines if you choose to use a slide deck.

- Use text sparingly to highlight crucial points—not do the speaking for you.
- Employ visuals to support explanations.
- Consider the slides the structure that help you stay on track.
- Limit the use of transitions, animation, and GIF files.

# **Practice your delivery, but not too much**

The secret to delivering a confident presentation is to practice, especially if you don't feel comfortable with public speaking. You want to strike a balance between knowing what you want to say and attempting to memorize a script.

Memorization can make you sound robotic, or it can cause you to forget things as you try to remember exact lines. Instead, think about remembering the flow of your important points and let your explanation of each point vary naturally as you speak.

As you're learning this skill, it can be extremely helpful to give your presentation to someone who can give you good feedback. Also, you can record yourself so you can self-evaluate.

Overall, don't get caught up in making your presentation perfect. You should not delay your assessment while spending days getting ready.

# **Prepare for the unexpected**

Another reason not to get too bogged down in perfecting your presentation is that you need to respond to changing conditions on the fly. Frequently, things don't go as planned.

Perhaps the monitor won't work, so you can't use your slide deck. If the team needs to wrap up early, you would need to condense your talk into a shorter time span. Perhaps you are asked questions that lead you down a different path than you had planned.

Staying flexible and thinking on your feet can help you succeed regardless of the constraints. If something unexpected happens, take a deep breath and roll with it—you know your project inside and out.

If you're asked a question that you don't have the answer to, it's totally acceptable to respond, "I'm not sure about that. I'll have to look into it and get back to you." (Just make sure that you follow up.)

# **How your presentation will be assessed by the educators at Thinkful**

Just like at the end of the Fundamentals phase, your grading team will meet with you and assess the entire arc of your work for the UX Intensive. We want to be transparent about this process, so you know how to prepare for this presentation, and the criteria being used to evaluate your progress as a designer and your work is clear.

Copy and paste this checklist into a new Google Doc.

Check off each one when you can affirm that you are ready to present it:

Go through this checklist and mark off every box once you have confirmed that this material is ready to be presented. Checking boxes feels like a nice accomplishment, and once you're done, you will be ready to present your work and finish this phase of the program!

# **Assignment #1**

# **Securing a client for the *Team design* modules**

Remember your assignment from *Graduating with the fundamentals*? You were instructed to do the following:

> Prepare for your future real-world team design project by finding a real-life client. Although you won't be working on a full UX team as part of this program, it's important that you learn to start negotiating the journey of designing for someone other than yourself. For this reason, your assignment in this checkpoint is to find a client who you'll build a project for during the Team design portion of the program. You have several weeks to find a client, so don't panic—but you should start searching for one now.This should not be an actual paying client, as it's a bit too early for that kind of pressure. Almost everyone has someone in their lives—a friend, family member, or coworker—who has said that they have a great idea for a product if only they knew how to build it. Now is your chance to help them bring their idea to life.

You're about to begin your *Team design* coursework! Are you prepared with a real, live client?

- Did you find a client from your network of friends, family, coworkers, and fellow students? *In your design journal, list their name and what they want built.*
- Did you interview your potential client to gather more details about their idea? *In your design journal, list any details you have acquired so far about them and what they want built.*
- Did you ensure that your client narrowed the scope of their idea to something that's feasible? *In your design journal, explain how you did this.*
- Did you make sure that this client is available for at least three 30-minute virtual interviews with you during your three-week *Team design* segment of this program? *In your design journal, confirm that you and your client committed to these interviews.*
- Did you explain to your potential client that you'll deliver a limited clickable prototype of their idea? Did you explain that you'll use this work as part of your professional portfolio? *In your design journal, explain how you presented your capabilities and the limited scope of this project.*

Your grading team will review this entry during your upcoming assessment.

# **UX intensive: Assessment instructions**

# **Overview and purpose**

As you have learned throughout the course so far, there are several phases of the design process. While you want to ensure that you've covered each component prior to development, this assessment is also an opportunity to prepare for one of the most overlooked components in design—the presentation of your work.

In this assessment, the strength of your work is judged far less on how it looks and more heavily on why it exists. Of particular importance is communicating why you made the decisions to produce the work that you plan to present. You will present the work you've completed over the course of the preceding challenges on your bus project.

# **Process**

Each assessment is an interview composed of equal parts problem definition, research review, information display, visual aesthetics, prototyping, testing, and the presentation's design.

The assessments are performed remotely by teleconference, much like mentor meetings. As your mentor is not responsible for your assessments, that task has been delegated to other program representatives. Receiving an assessment from a stranger more accurately replicates the job interview environment.

### Be mindful when scheduling your interview. You should only cancel or reschedule if it's an emergency. Treat this call like you would a real job interview. Rescheduling looks bad to prospective employers and demonstrates a lack of professionalism. Failing to attend a scheduled interview with no notice counts as a failed interview.

This brings you to the next point. *Treat each assessment with utmost seriousness*. The more you commit to the experience, the more you'll take out of it. Design interviews are high-pressure situations, and your future employers won't give you a practice round.

### Make sure you update your settings and security permissions in Notion to allow your assessors access to your workspace.

# **Presentation format**

Present your work on your bus project along with your final prototype. Your presentation should be 20 to 30 minutes long. It will be graded across 11 important skills:

1. Communicate core concepts
2. Plan projects effectively
3. Collect data
4. Draw inferences from data
5. Ideate and create multiple concepts
6. Make strategic decisions
7. Articulate and justify design decisions
8. Create deliverables
9. Navigate new tools
10. Design for accessibility
11. Present clearly

Describe your process chronologically and show your work. Your assessor will want to hear about your design process, and how everything you learned in the early phases of your project informed your decisions and final designs.

Treat this assessment as a real job experience. Come prepared, and practice your presentation in advance. Speak confidently about your project and highlight your hard work!

# **How you're scored**

There are 33 possible points in this assessment, and you need to score at least 27 points to pass the assessment. Each skill is rated out of 3 points, representing the following categories:

- **3 points (Exceptional)**: You stand out in this ability as a new UX designer.
- **2 points (Proficient)**: You are at the appropriate level in this ability for a new UX designer.
- **1 points (Developing)**: You are not yet at the expected level in this ability for a new UX designer.

Your assessor will let you know your score and will give you any additional feedback within two business days of your presentation.

If your presentation falls below the minimum level, you will schedule a retake and make adjustments to improve your score. Consecutive unsuccessful assessments will result in more impactful actions to ensure that you master early concepts.
