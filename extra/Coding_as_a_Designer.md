# Chapter 5: Coding as an UI/UX Designer

## Overview
This chapter is about being a designer, while being able to code. Clearly at a technical level being a designer means that technical coding skills will never be at par with a developer. A developer will be able to have a deep understanding on coding methodologies as well as inside knowledge on intricate working of the actual system itself. A designer only needs to understand development up to the point of it's usability. For example if there is a web app dashboard which has the tech stack of being a wordpress site, then as a designer understanding to a certain extent that there is a thing that is an admin dashboard will greatly improve their overall understanding the limitations of the technology itself, to pull back the curtain of the mystic, which to the designer is the code. Once that magic layer is broken, then the designer can have a more fundamental understanding of the medium, of which iks to be utilized.


# **Let's talk about code: Frontend, backend, and full-stack development**

Are you curious about pursuing the frontend coding specialization option in this program, but still feeling unclear about the industry lingo? Backend, frontend, and full-stack development are three separate career paths, but these terms are sometimes treated interchangeably. Add in "web design", "frontend designer", and whatever new job title has been invented this week, and it gets very confusing.

To put it plainly, backend developers are focused on data, modeling, and the backend of a website. Basically, this is the stuff that gets saved on a server but isn't what you see on the screen. Frontend developers help build what customers and users interact with and see. And full-stack developers do some or all of the above. This program is not aimed at training for any of those career paths, although it's not uncommon for a UI designer to move towards becoming a frontend developer later in their career.

What you *can* explore in this program is the intersection between code and design. This usually leads to the following job titles:

- Frontend web designer
- Web designer
- UI developer
- HTML/CSS developer

### Have you ever said to yourself, "I think I'll really enjoy making prototypes come to life?" If so, you'll probably want to pursue a UX or UI design career with a web design specialization. This can give you a taste of programming skills and allow you to build a simple website.


# **The visuals: User interface design and frontend design**

Learning objective: *In this checkpoint, you will be able to compare and contrast UI, UX, and frontend development. You will evaluate the essential components of these varying career paths, and you will begin planning which specialization to focus on later in this program.*

So far, you have learned about the foundations and the fundamental components of UX design. In this checkpoint, you'll analyze the visual elements of design, focusing on user interface design and frontend development. You'll compare and contrast the roles of UX and UI designers and consider what each contributes to the app-building process. Then you will explore the different career paths that are available to you as a graduate of this program. You will also research these visual design paths and begin to plan which route you want to take during the specialization checkpoints later in this program.

A UX designer's goal is to empathize with users and keep their goals and pain points in mind, while enabling them to accomplish their tasks in an intuitive and streamlined manner.

UX is not an exact science—trial and error is part of the process. The UX designer starts by identifying barriers and problems during the discovery phase. Then, they use multiple methods to determine the best solutions. Using thorough research, they test results and revise solutions based on performance and feedback throughout the process. They also use personas to ensure that the user is represented and advocated for every step of the way—from loose ideas and sketches to site maps, wireframes, prototypes, user journeys, and user flows.

Once the foundation is ready, and site maps, navigation, and content are in place, the UI designer brings the product to life with visual and interactive design. A UI designer's day-to-day work involves determining the placement of elements, balancing the negative space, and keeping abreast of trends while also applying the principles of classic design. The UX designer maps out the path, and the UI designer fleshes out the details within the path. UI designers are also responsible for ensuring that a product meets accessibility requirements and is inclusive in its design. They determine which combinations of color and background color should be used to create contrast to improve legibility, including for users with color blindness.

Here's a summary of the differences between UX and UI:

- In the real world, you will most often be either designing the overall user experience (UX) or considering the granular design of the user interface (UI).
- UX design finds usability problems and solves them; UI design creates interfaces that are interactive and visually appealing.
- UX should always come first when developing a product. The problem should be well defined, and the UI design should happen after the problem is solved. The skeleton of the user journey should be brought to life with interactive and visual components.
- UX is applicable to any type of service or product; it is not restricted to the screen. By contrast, UI is concerned with digital interfaces only.

### Imagine that you developed an app that improved people's lives and solved a common and significant pain point in a new and creative way. The usability research and discovery yielded a good understanding of which features to include, and a map of the user journey was created. Once the app was released, it was quickly downloaded by hundreds of people who were excited to use it and try it out. But when they installed it, they quickly discovered that the app's text was difficult to read; the use of red type against a black background was too low in contrast. And the lack of a search bar meant that users had to dig through every menu to find what they were looking for. This example shows how poor UI can undo all the good done with UX.

# **A case study on bad UI: Google Glass**

This quote from *MIT Technology Review* summarizes the core usability issues with Google Glass. In a nutshell, the problem can be traced back to Google's lack of empathy for their users when they designed the product. They failed to properly research their personas and user flows, which could have made the navigation and experience easier to understand.

In 2013, Google released Google Glass, which was the first product of its type for the company. The results for the new and exciting wearable tech were underwhelming. Aspects of the UI worked: users could send messages, take photos, and easily view information. But the product neglected to address actual user needs and pain points. Although the concept seemed effective on paper, in practice, the features did not fulfill user needs. The UX—and therefore the product as a whole—failed tremendously.
x
In addition, Google Glass featured a hidden camera that could be turned on and off discreetly. This feature proved to be problematic and invasive because other people didn't know if or when they were being filmed. If a product has a trust issue like this from the get-go, it's a usability red flag. When other people view the product's user as a pariah, that's a big usability issue.

Remember how UI design is not only for visual interfaces, but also for voice-activated interfaces? Google Glass had a voice-activated interface, and it proved to be embarrassing and socially unacceptable to bark out commands in public. In fact, it was terrible. There are thousands of memes making fun of these poor Google Glass users. There are even characters in movies (such as the 2019 film *Wine Country*) who epitomize the socially impaired, empathy-lacking loser when they loudly use voice-activated commands regardless of the context. Google lacked empathetic understanding of the context and environment in which the product would be used. And in the end, the product's users felt uncomfortable about announcing every task to Google Glass. No one who was self aware would be caught wearing them. In fact, because of the undetectable camera feature, some users were shunned or even physically assaulted by people who were scared that they were being recorded.

# **Multidisciplinary teams**

A small company may have only one designer, while larger companies with bigger budgets may have several design or product people on a team. A lean team will be more focused on execution, while a more robust team may have an information architect, who focuses on organizing information logically, as well as a dedicated user researcher. A designer on an agile team or Scrum team may work on a multidisciplinary team alongside engineers, product managers, and marketing or business professionals. You'll learn more about agile development later in the program.
