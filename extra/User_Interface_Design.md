# Chapter 3: User Interface Design
## User Interface Design (UI)

User Interface (UI) : Designs of the User Interface in relation to the visual styling and/or functionality of the Interface in various use cases scenarios. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for consumer mobile applications and web based application. But not limited to Graphical Interfaces. Interfaces are designed based on the limitations of the devices and the applications that are to be used on particular devices, paramount to understanding the design direction of an User Interface. Limitations on the design of User Interfaces include size of device screen real estate, pixel density of screens, Operating systems of the devices, pre-existing design patterns, computer software frameworks, User Personas Feelings and more. The interaction and the design of that interaction, Interaction Design (IxD) between Humans and Machines, in this particular context, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a deeper understanding of the interactions between the Human User and the Machine Computer, in particular how that User interacts with that machine, and the underlining psychological reasoning behind the User's decision making while the interaction is at play. The methods that said User interacts with the machine, commonly this interaction is facilitated by an User Interface via Web Browser and/or Native Mobile Application. 


# **What is user interface design?**

User interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) design are often confused with each other. In fact, in your career, you may frequently encounter misunderstandings about what they are and how they are different from each other. Many job descriptions and hiring managers conflate the two and consider them interchangeable or struggle to fully understand the difference between them.

UX design concerns the way that users interact with an application, website, or other type of product or program. It focuses on the user's onscreen and offscreen experience. And it deals with the following questions: Is it easy and intuitive? Does it save the person's time?

In contrast, UI design focuses specifically on the screen. It incorporates visual design, including layout, color theme, and use of negative space between elements. It also takes into consideration the best components to use, based on user stories and wireframes. UI design can include graphic design; UI designers are sometimes responsible for designing custom icons, logos, and typography. UI designers also need working knowledge of frontend coding so that they can communicate with developers.

UI designers need to understand responsive design; they need to know the differences between the features and elements that are used on a smartphone and those that are used on a tablet or computer. They have to consider the specific set of controls that a user interacts with to use an application. And this isn't restricted just to visual interfaces; voice-controlled interfaces (such as Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa) are becoming more popular too.

A UI designer's main goal is to make the user's experience with the surface of a product pleasurable, smooth, and frictionless. The UI design delivers fashion as well as function. There should be enough whitespace that users can focus on the elements and easily find what they are looking for. Part of UI design is understanding how to curate and activate space; clutter is confusing, and more is not always better. There should also be an effort to give the interface personality and make it fun to use.

User interface design, like user experience design, is a challenging role with multiple responsibilities. A UI designer has the task of interpreting and synthesizing a product's research and development into an intuitive and beautiful layout.

# **The difference between UX and UI design**

Since UX and UI design are such specialized fields, even professionals can mix them up or assume that they are no different from web design. A user interface that lacks UX design could have a deceptively beautiful and slick layout that is confusing to use, disorganized, and can't perform the functions that the user needs. And on the other hand, UX without UI looks clumsy and rough, with no elegance or visual treatment. Both UX and UI are essential for a successful product.

UX and UI are complementary, and each serves an important function. There is some overlap, and having a working knowledge of one as a practitioner of the other will enhance your skill set. Some organizations combine these two roles, while others separate them into distinct positions.

UI design is about the way that the interface looks and behaves, while UX is about the user's experience while using the product both on and off the screen. UI is the fancy sports car, and UX is the feeling of driving down the road.


# **User delight is UI success**

User interfaces are how users access and control an application or device. These interfaces can take several forms:

- **Graphical user interfaces**, or GUIs, are a design's visual control panels and faces
- **Voice-controlled interfaces** rely on oral-auditory interactions ("Alexa! Hey Google! Help me find … ")
- **Gesture-based interfaces**, such as Smart Mirror virtual gyms, involve users using bodily motions to engage with 3D design spaces

User interface design is fun and challenging, especially since users are often swift to judge designs on how enjoyable and useful they are. The goal is to provide user interfaces that are pleasurable, usable, and efficient. UI designers are tasked with creating the illusion that users aren't interacting with a device, but rather trying to attain goals directly and as effortlessly as possible.

Software is intangible, and UI designers strive to achieve unobtrusive features while still offering access points so that users can control the product. A UI designer's job is to sustain this "magic" by letting users find their way about the interface intuitively. For most products, the less that users have to pay attention to the mechanisms of control, the more they'll immerse themselves and feel that the experience is personal, effortless, and engaging. A product's interface design should be as enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing, and as engaging as possible.


# **Top eight UI principles**

By this point, you understand that UI designers are responsible for designing intuitive and beautiful interfaces. But you may be wondering what that looks like in practice. What goes into designing a good interface?

Every UI designer has their own opinion about the most important elements of a successful user interface. But as a starting point, you should consider these eight principles to get an idea of the characteristics that UI professionals focus on in their day-to-day work.

- **Naturalness:** A UI design should allow the user to use the device in a way that feels natural. They should be able to access the controls in ways that feel normal or expected to them. If you're interested in reading more about how to achieve this, check out **[this article about designing natural user interfaces](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/natural-user-interfaces-what-are-they-and-how-do-you-design-user-interfaces-that-feel-natural?ep=ux-planet)**.
- **Consistency:** All features of an interface should be consistent and easy to use. This includes the look, feel, and behavior of all elements. Consistency allows users to learn from a single task and then apply what they learned across the board more quickly and efficiently. To see what this looks like in action, look through the **[examples of great app design in this article](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/the-importance-of-consistency-in-ui-design/)**.
- **Friendliness:** User-friendly and thoughtful interfaces can help users avoid scenarios that result in errors. Users eventually learn through research and experimentation, and you should take this into account when you're designing an interface.
- **Interaction:** Interaction guides how a user engages with an interface. The interface should offer various functions, features, and services that allow the user to get from one point to another easily and conveniently. An interface should also have *parity*, which often means that the digital design mirrors or resembles real-world designs. If the UI is familiar or recognizable in some way, it'll probably be more accessible and easier for people to use. For instance, a notepad on a smartphone will likely look like a physical notepad. The interface should also match the standard design guidelines of the company, application, or system.
- **Transparency:** Pare down whenever possible and include only essentials. Don't go overboard with too many features and clutter the interface.
- **Strong visual hierarchy:** A strong visual hierarchy is key for communicating which components on the screen are most important. This hierarchy allows the user to seamlessly move from one interface element to another. If you're interested, you can read more about creating visual hierarchy in **[this article from Tubik Studio](https://tubikstudio.com/visual-hierarchy-effective-ui-content-organization/)**.
- **Step-by-step information flow:** The screen should show only the necessary information. Not all elements should be presented at once; they should be thoughtfully organized and revealed only when relevant.
- **Invisibility:** The user should be able to focus on their goals without being distracted by the interface. Minimalism is good, and less is almost always better.

# **What does a UI designer do all day?**

A UX designer draws out the map and outlines the skeleton of a product. Backend developers make the product work and fill in the organs. Then a UI designer fleshes out the product with visual, interactive touchpoints that are intuitive and easy to comprehend and follow.

A UI designer always keeps user expectations and consistency in mind. To see why this is important, imagine that you are using an app to search for a new home. In the gallery, you click on the thumbnail of a house that you'd like to take a look at. The image expands after you select it, and you see the numbers "1/19" written in the corner of the screen. This is a standard pattern, so you can expect that the numbers indicate how many photos of the home are available. As the user, you anticipate swiping to click through them.

Your role as a UI designer will vary greatly depending on whether you're in-house or freelance. It will also depend on the kinds of projects that you work on and the organization that you work for.


# **Collaboration**

Unlike some graphic design roles, a UI designer rarely works solo. It is a highly collaborative role that depends on clear communication and feedback from other teams and departments. Technical constraints, brand voice, and budget all factor into the UI designer's day-to-day responsibilities. Especially in the beginning, you should expect to work closely with both the client and the UX designer. UX/UI design is all about humans and how they use a product, so you'll need to spend some time getting to know the brand and the users. A UI designer asks, "What are my users' goals? Does my design accommodate them and facilitate success?"

As a UI designer, you'll take the information gathered by user researchers and UX designers. You'll transform these inputs—such as wireframes, personas, sketches, and user journey maps—into visual and experiential interfaces. After you finish designing the visual or auditory experience, you'll hand the whole thing over to the developers.

Building relationships across different teams and being able to communicate clearly are crucial to the success of your project. Just like with UX, UI designers need to employ empathy when they engage with users, colleagues, teammates, stakeholders, and clients. If you hate interacting with people, this is not the career for you.


# **Design**

As a UI designer, you'll be designing screens and creating visual touchpoints, as well as orchestrating the interactivity behind them. UI designers begin a project by creating a style guide, or visual language, to be used throughout the design process. You'll be responsible for ensuring consistency with the product's visuals, content, style, and feel.

To get a better sense of a UI designer's day-to-day work, put yourself in the shoes of the UI designer at the small (fictional) agency Potato Gods. Here are some typical tasks that your project manager might give you:

- Design each individual screen with which the user will interact. You'll need to answer the following questions:
    - What should go here, and here?
    - How much space should be left between each element?
    - What visual patterns and hierarchies make for an intuitive user experience?
- Consider the responsiveness of the product, and outline how it will be used.
- Create a style guide based on the user research that you have on hand.
- Design elements such as buttons, icons, sliders, and scroll bars.
- Create animations, and design the interactivity of each element. Consider questions such as "What does this button do when a user clicks on it?"
- Choose colors and typefaces based on the user research and your knowledge of visual design and aesthetics.


# **Prototyping**

Just like with UX design, you'll need to regularly test your design's usability with users. Prototypes are a critical component of the UI workflow because they simulate the actual experience of using an application. By testing early and often with multiple users, you can gain vital feedback. This feedback can then be implemented with revisions near the beginning of the process—instead of after the product is released. The final product should be usable, pleasing, and flawless.
