# Chapter 2: Designer Journey

What is the design journey?
 
In the context of this book, it is about how to become a designer.
 
It's about the journey of becoming a designer.
 
How do you get to become an UX Designer?
 
Before going over step by step what led someone to pursue UX Design as a profession, it is important to note that the background of an individual can have more impact on one's choices in the future than we know. So for people who are still uncertain about what the future holds, let's take a step back together and piece together what led you to choosing UX Design as a profession.
 
Because there are so many different types of background, and avenues where people took to get here it isn't very clear at times, what the exact journey really is.
 
The best way to become an UX Designer is to get a degree in UX Design at an accredited university. For example a Bachelor's degree in UX Design. Afterwards there are graduate programs for example in Human Computer Interaction.
 
There was a time before there was UX Design available as a choice at university. So for a certain demographic there was no option for UX Design.
 
Background isn't everything. Talk about your personality and what kind of person you are to have a uniquely natural affinity to design, art, creativity.
 
And the steps it took to make it as an UI/UX Designer.
 
1. Appreciation and a background in the arts
 
Fine Art for the people born before the start of the internet, Yes you I see you and I am going to tell you that it is not too late and it is not impossible to become an UX Designer, an appreciation for the arts is key. You have to love what you do... if you want to become a Designer because of the salary you will be wrong.
 
2. Affinity with Technology
 
Technology devices is one of the mediums that UX Designers use.
 
3. Deep connection with empathy
 
This is something that cannot really be bought or even learned in an institution setting.
 
But practicing good accessibility laws and standards will meet most empathy problems.
 
What about the development of UX Designer Skill Sets?
 
When do you know when you are good enough as a Designer?
 
Talk about the my journey maybe they can learn from my journey
 
Now I would like to share my personal design journey, and we can begin to break apart piece by piece the steps it took to become a Designer. As well as the process of shifting into a different design medium such as UX. Or looked at in a product lens then changing product to UI.
 
My personal journey as a designer started from a background in the Fine Arts.

In High School, attended Mission San Jose High School in the Silicon Valley, California, took AP Art.

After High School, I attended Hongik University in Seoul for Industrial Design for a year. Actually my background is still in the process but I can share things up to know.
 
![Welcome](../../../files/img/5.PNG)
 
So the first major I picked was Industrial Design.
 
After returning to the United States of America, I attended DeAnza College in Cupertino for Graphic Design.

I transferred from DeAnza College to California College of the Arts In San Francisco, CA and Oakland, CA. My major I kept as Industrial Design.
 
![Welcome](../../../files/img/6.PNG)
 
I did an internship at downtown San Francisco in the Spear tower at a mobile application startup. For UI/UX Design and Graphic Design Intern.
 
## Story Starts Here
 
So this is where the UX story starts, because this is a design journey everything that led up to this point was everything besides UX.
 
So where were you when that transition happened?
 
Because to become a designer, you have to pick a major related to design. Now you are a designer, but you have to finish college, and you have to have relevant skill sets. So everyone here is a designer. But the question is when did you make the transition into UX?
 
Because I started as an Industrial Designer, I was unaware of this industry called UX Design. I was looking for a job in 2016, which turned into an internship at the Spear tower in Downtown San Francisco (SOMA), for a UI/UX and Graphic Design Internship.
 
Is this luck? There are many ways to look for an internship, for example job fairs at California College of the Arts, where various companies show up to look for qualified interns.
 
When I started my internship, I was mainly doing office tasks, for example buying for the office from Target, office tasks, and others.
 
One of the first tasks was to make graphics related to their logo.

There I did my first UI Design, I will share it here.
 
![Welcome](../../../files/img/9.PNG)
 
I will now critique this UI Design.
 
I know this is your first design. It's not bad for a first design. It shows quite a lot of creativity and attempted innovation. But just based on even just the text hierarchy it is clear this design is quite amateurish.  
 
But there is some basic understanding about things like buttons, or indicators, as well as attempts to create padding and margin rules from nothing.
 
For someone with no previous experience doing UI design, this is actually not the worst thing, ever, because it does show some basic design understanding. As well as an attempt to create something that mimics UI Design rules.
 
What I like about this design is that it is original. Because of that fact, this design is passable.
 
An original design is better than an amazing prebuilt.. at least when it comes to personal expectations.Actually starting from a prebuilt and then working on the design will save a lot of time and will solve most of these padding issues, and text issues, as well as this design being done back in 2015, where it was for the iphone 5, now we are iphone max 12.
 
I did a 3 month internship and my favorite design I did for that startup is this one here.

This is actually two designs. One it showcases a UI inside the UI. The design is for an onboarding screen, and that onboarding screen uses an UI that was designed for the Production Application.
 
![Welcome](../../../files/img/14.PNG)
 
This one is slightly better, and it shows that there was improvement, for example the use of text and the hierarchy of the text is a lot better.
 
As well as the positioning of the elements on the User Interface.
 
This one is better and shows a lot of improvement.

So now what?
 
During this period of time, learn how to program in standard computer languages. The main reason was so I could create a website to have a portfolio. So because of that I learned HTML/CSS and even started to be able to read JavaScript. I was also inspired by the people around me who motivated me to learn how to program, without them I wouldn't have had the motivation to learn such a technical skill.
 
I go back to school at California College of the Arts, this time for Interaction Design with Computational Practices.
 
There my eyes were opened, really actually by my amazing professors, which showed me the other side, the side that I didn't really know existed. and that side is called User Experience.
 
Because everything I did at this point was mainly visual, the User Interfaces looked OK but there was not really any solid research to backup the designs. There needs to be solid documentation on the reasons why a design was chosen over another.
 
There I started to learn about things such as User Testing
 
There is so much more than just the visuals.
 
And they were absolutely correct that there is much more under the surface than what is seen.
 
For example
 
Using my background in understanding HTML and CSS, I created designs that integrated technical coding and user interface design, as well as paying attention to user experience, in this particular case accessibility.
 
So now we are here, and I am finishing up my bachelor degree in Graphic Design with Web Design, at Southern New Hampshire University. Doing everything remote, transferred in half the credits. Also to note for people wondering how this is financially possible, I am a scholarship recipient, I received CCA Scholarship, Cal Grant B, Clorox Scholarship, Pell Grant. Additionally throughout my college experience I always work one or two or three part time jobs and gigs. Also Throughout college I was signed up with the United States  Selective Services which was what allowed me to fund my higher education, because of this I also received federal work study. Because of this I always struggled to keep my academics and finances separate but, now I have a 3.5 Overall GPA at Southern New Hampshire University. My education dream is to continue to finish my bachelor degree and then get my masters degree in Computer Interaction Design.
 
## Now it's your turn
 
Lets create your Designer Journey based on this template
 
This template is your explanation for why you have become an UX Designer, as well as the journey you went on to becoming an UX Designer. If the question does not apply to you please skip and answer the ones that apply to you.
 
**Pep Talk**
 
Listen, not everyone can sacrifice so much to become who they want to become. Maybe your background is to say the least, extra ordinary. In this case, I would highly suggest that without let's say a high school diploma or a GED, that staying in school is probably a good choice. Now that we have covered that, you can become an UX Designer without a high school diploma. Yes, I said it, you can become an UX Designer without a High School Diploma, now if you really think in the long term that putting a few hours in now that you have time to investing into your future as a designer getting that High School Degree or GED can and will help you in the future. You have a background in UX Design if you look hard enough you can create your own destiny.
