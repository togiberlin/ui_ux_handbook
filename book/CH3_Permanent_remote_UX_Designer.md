# Chapter 8: Permanent Remote UX Designer

## Overview

Covid-19 did change many things for many people around the globe.

But before Covid-19 there were many things put into place to facilliate the possibility of remote work. 

For example the improvement of network speeds, video conference software and other productivity tools, that allow individuals to do work even when things are done remotely.

Because of this, a new way of approaching work needs to be invisioned.

## Permanent Remote UX Designer

This may be a dream to some, or to others this could be a nightmare.

But the possibilty of a job being done remotely has much to do with the deliverables that the output of the work is in.

For UX Design because most of the deliverables are digital assets, a transfer of those assets can be done as simily as sending an email.

## Staying a remote worker

The hardest part about being a remote worker, is when the boss wants you to stop being a remote worker and they want you to come into the office in person. Or when a company is looking for someone remote but eventually this person would need to relocate to a different physical location. Because of this a role that at first looks like it will be remote turns into a thing where you will need to go back into the office.

When applying for jobs, apply for jobs that specifically state remote, as well as if applying to jobs in the local area, ask if this role is remote. If the position is in the local area, going into the office occasionally is something that is possible.

To stay a permanent remote worker, carefuly planning and intential application process to only remote positions will allow one to become and stay a permanent remote ux designer.

## PROS and CONS of Working Remotely

There are many pros and cons of working remotely, 

One of the main pros of working remotely is being able to control more of your immediate physical surroundings.

For example in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley, the traffic going into the city can be crowded during rush hour.

One of the main pros is not having to drive in rush hour traffic.

A Cons is staying dislipled and motivated, being more involved in your own productivity.

## For people who already have experience working remotely

Are you also looking towards the future to see how it can be possible for the job to be permanently remote?

## Covid-19

Post Covid-19, companies are warming to the concept of a remote worker. But before that all, there was a niche but vibrant ecosystem of remote online freelancer and contractors.

A quick explanation, and context. There has been a boom of a so called gig economy, where people do piece work instead of being on a full time basis with benefits. There are also contractors which could have full time hours but without benefits. There are many PROs and CONs of both. Research both before deciding on any path. This will be about a specific path. Being a Freelance UX Designer.

Working remotely is difficult for some jobs such as a Grocery Store Warehouse Worker, but some jobs in which some key principles are met.

1. The output of their work is a deliverable that can be distributed via the internet.
2. Resources and Assets are distributed across business infrastructure
3. Flexible Team and Highly Motivated Team

As an UX Designer, there can be difficulties with reaching certain clients because of the physical distance of remote work. But if something can be discussed with a client over a phone call then the work can go forward. Because of the instant nature of the internet it is easier than ever keep on track with the team.

Waking up to be on time at at a different time zone.

If you are on the west coast and the client is on the east coast, it can be a good habit to wake up on time with the rest of the east coast PST to EST.
