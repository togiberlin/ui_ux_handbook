# Chapter 4: UX Design Portfolio

## Overview

As a designer, your portfolio is one of the main things that have been around since you can remember. If you are looking to make an UX Design Portfolio and you come from a background in Fine Art, making the transition to digitial can be a hurtle.

One of the main things are websites for designers. These website are showcase site of the designer's portfolio, as well as being an opportunity to present their own personal style. 

The best way to have full customizable ability of a portfolio site is to understand the underlining technologies of the site itself. There are also various plugins or online drag and drop builders that allow designers to design their site without using code.

## Custom Portfolio Websites

After my internship as an UI/UX Designer, I spent time putting together my first UI/UX Designer Portfolio. Not only was this my first UI/UX Designer Portfolio, but it was also my first time looking at HTML/CSS/JS. Initally I took templates and made small adjustments to the styling, and eventually I began to understand more fundamental codings such as jquery, as well as bootstrap. 

But being able to build a site without using any kinds of frameworks, as well as no libraries is an important part of understand how website work.

### JavaScript Frameworks

Although it can be difficult with a developer, when a Portfolio Website can be built using a Single Page Web Application methogology then it can present a better finished product to the end user.

## End User

Who is the end user of an UX Designer Portfolio Website?

There can be many different types of Personas that can be invisioned to being interested in an UX Designer's Portfolio.

1. Recruiter

Recruiters will be interested in an UX Designer's Portfolio. Although the Resume can also be something that they will be interested in. For recruiters, they talk a look at the site at times to just verify that the site does exist to a capacity. From Recruiters, they present job opportunities to designers, and facilitate their career growth in corporate america.

2. Clients

Clients can look at UX Designer's Portfolio, whom are interested in getting work done by the designer. Clients can guage alot from just taking a look at a designer's Portfolio and depending on the client they may present more of a value on the quality of the Portfolio.

3. Designers

Other Designers are interested in UX Designer's Portfolio. Because designers tend to compare their skills and projects, a portfolio can be a way designers interact with each other in the job market. Also based on each other portfolios, helps designers understand where they are in a spectrum of skillsets.

4. Management

Management can be interested in an UX Designer's Portfolio. Although internal work is a priority, management can look at a Portfolio to see potential places and gain more of an understanding of what the designer is at skillwise as well as their personal styling.

## Final Thoughts

There are more ways than portfolios to showcase work, or skillsets. As designers move further and further along in their journeys they may discover that some of their best projects they can not share on their portfolio or that there are other ways to show skills and styling. 

For designers looking to stay on track with the industry, a maintained and updated portfolio website is one of the best ways to stay relevant in the industry. Being able to show that they are still following industry trends and that they are still revelvant, and modern.

While every designer has their own path, as well as eventually discovering other paths that eventually cause their portfolio to be of less importance. For designers looking to practice and stay relevant in their talents, and skillsets, having a portfolio website is a great way to interact with recruiters, clients, other designers, and management to express your artist talent in a personal way with your own personal portfolio website.

# Are UI/UX Designer Portfolios still relevant in 2022?

Here is why UI/UX Designer Portfolios are relevant in 2022, also for any other creative field that requires a thing such as a portfolio. The best way to understand a creative portfolio is by thinking of it as an artist’s self expression of style, and specification. Eventually there will be a certain look that fit a certain company’s design better than another designer who has more experience in another space. 

There are certain looks that certain companies are looking for and it’s difficult to understand the art behind the person, to understanding how a portfolio is a demonstration of the skillsets as well as the methods that the designer or artist used to design a collection of works such as a portfolio.

A portfolio should have a directive or a message, that message could be a demonstration of skillsets, such as advanced design and artistic skill. Also there needs to be certain level of quality across the portfolio pieces. The portfolio piece could be one individual piece, such as an artpiece that is done with watercolor or color pencil, on a canvas. Or a portfolio piece could be a case study for an User Experience design on a Mobile User Interface Web Application. 

For people from a fine art background it is easy to understand why a portfolio will most likely never be a thing that an artist doesnt need. For example they may need it to start applying for art schools in High School. There are certain art schools across the world and in America that require a portfolio to apply to those schools. 

If there is a person going into school for an art major, they sometimes require a portfolio to showcase their understanding of the topic that they are showcasing an interest for. As so for people trying to get into the industry the people who applied for art schools for college already had an art portfolio.

There were many people that I met during high school that took Art I,II,III and AP Art. Some people took those classes for fun, or to learn something that was creative. There were also people that eventually built out a portfolio for themselves during the years of doing creative works, eventually there is collection of various creative artworks that can be used to create a portfolio.

Using this portfolio during High School, art students applied to art colleges. So to join certain art colleges the students require an art portfolio. So for those students it is easy to understand that an art portfolio is what is going to be a significant part of the process. Indeed even the best portfolio cant help a poor student, but a great student wouldnt be considered without a portfolio. 

So in 2021, as designers who work in User Experience designing User Interfaces for Mobile Application and Web Application portfolios are and will continue to be an important part of being a designer.

# UX Portfolio

## First off what is a UX Design Portfolio and is it important? And if it is important why is it important? Is it possible to not have to have a portfolio?

There are a few trains of thought. There are people who think portfolios are not relevant and there are some people who think portfolios are relevant.

It really depends on what the portfolio is being used for.

Also to try to understand how an UX Designer portfolio can be used.

The earliest time to make a portfolio when back in high school, and even before high school, during after school art classes.

During these after school programs, there were times where I would spend numerous hours possibly around a 3PM-7PM, working on my art pieces at the private art studio.

During this time, I learned how to draw with pencil and use color pencil as well as other mediums, as well as understanding various perspective and abstract concepts.

During these sessions I would draw a piece for a month and spend hours carefully drawing it with pencil and color pencil, and markers, etc. The time would fly by and then the piece would be completed.

After a while there was a collection of art pieces.

When I started high school, I took Art I. Then I took Art II, Art III, and then AP Art.

During school I would draw in class and take extra after school classes at the art studio.

I didnt take art seriously enough and didnt take the AP Art test. Also I didnt have any plans after High School to go to art school, so I didnt have a portfolio ready.

## Many people get stuck around here, not taking the process seriously enough and not applying yourself can be the biggest problems.

But also I didnt know and there were not many people that could help me. I was an immigrant to this country.

I went to Korea and practices more at the art studios, and raised my drawing skill level, but I was never the best at drawing or sketching.

I applyied for Hongik University at Seoul for Industrial Design. There was no portfolio required instead just a entrance exam.

After I returned home to America, I attended De Anza College in Cupertino for Graphic Design. It was a community college so a portfolio was not required to apply.

I prepared to apply to California College of the Arts, and a portfolio was required.

So I prepared a portfolio from all the past works, and applied to California College of the Arts and got in.

The tuition was around 70K per year.

This was the first time that I ever really had a portfolio and the first time I really ever had to use the portfolio.

The portfolio that was used to apply to California College of the Arts, was to get me into the college and a certain level of skill needed to be shown as well as the portfolio being something that showed the interests.

Now after having spent time at CCA studying first Industrial Design, then later Interaction Design.

I took a break from school and appled to jobs around the San Francisco Bay Area.

I didnt have a portfolio all I had was a resume.

I got a job based off of what I could do as a office intern, but eventually it turned into a job related to UX design.

After the internship, I realized I didnt have a way to apply to jobs related to design.

So I created some of my first portfolios for UX.

The first ones were just designs of websites that I wanted to be portfolios.

They were never implemented but the full designs were there.

Also there wasent really a way to show any kind of work that had been done.

After I returned home and sat down and started to do work on a laptop.

What I started to do was to learn how to build a website.

The first website I built was my portfolio website.

This portfolio website was built with HTML/CSS/JS, and it didnt contain any portfolio pieces but rather was a single page of information.

I continued to work on this website.

And eventaully i began to apply to design jobs with this website.

This was back in 2016.

As expected the responses were not very good.

But evntually I got my first client, then I got another client.

But I had to start small, even grass roots type of individuals. But it all worked and i learned over the course of a few years to a few months. 

During the course of 3 years I worked with clients doing small gigs, and learning more about UX Design.

I returned to school at California College of the Arts in San Francisco in 2019, but this time my major was Interaction Design.

Covid-19 began in early 2020.

Over the course of a year or so, I have transfered to Southern New Hamshire University, and I have have worked with a few recent clients and have been putting hours into a portfolio website.

This portfolio website is the collimation of years and years of studying and art and design.

Starting from my first design portfolio to get into California College of the Arts, to the days spent at the art studio putting hours into an art portfolio.

Now I have come to a point where the portfolio I can use to apply for jobs and I am trying to apply to jobs that are 100K.

I believe that with my portfolio I can apply for jobs that are 100K, because during the interview I will use the portfolio to make the best presentation and impression.

After I get the job, I have to do the work and do the tasks that are related to UX and I dont mind at all, and using certain design tools are a breeze, as well as design topics.

This was my journey to creating my UX Design Portfolio, to becoming a 6 figure UX Designer.
