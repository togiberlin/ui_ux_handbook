# UX Designer Resume

I would like to share with you the journey to getting to the current iteration of the resume.
 
This is one of the first resumes that was used to apply for UI/UX Design jobs.

As you can see there is not much experience, as well as the experience being placed in incorrect order.
 
High Street Market was a grocery store in Itaewon, Seoul, South Korea. So yes, I did put in a job from a grocery story for job applications for UI/UX Designers.
 
Additionally the experience starts in 2012. The other experiences are also very sparse, such as the instructor for Freshi Media, and then the internship at Uguru, INC for UI/UX Design.
 
Finally the skills are very low and not specialized as well as putting Industrial Design tools as well.

The next resume is another design that focuses a lot on the personal statement, as well the skills.
 
Most of the experience and the education which is on the right hand corner, is not very good, as you can see this was before I started as a freelancer, independent contractor.

This resume is for junior web developers, which is a position that I also applied for while looking for jobs. There has not been much progress in the job experience nor the education.
 
Added skills that were relevant to web development.

This is where I started to put the clients that I worked with as a freelancer. You can see that it was mostly a short amount of time, working with various clients.

This is the resume applying as a Web Developer, as you can see the skills have been updated for web developers. As well as additional work experiences.

This resume is an UX/UI Designer resume, which was done at a bootcamp called Thinkful. Based on their feedback, I created this UX/UI Designer resume.

This is the current version of the resume.

Here is the resume in another format, with two columns. This format is useful. Note that in western societies it is common for people to read from the left to the right.
 
As you can see it takes multiple iterations to create the career that you desire. Additionally starting off, resumes will not look great, nor will they have much job experience. But as you can see with effort and continually applying and getting better position, you can slowly climb yourself upwards as a freelancer or as a remote independent contractor. This method is particularly useful for people who didn't start from the best of places and they are looking for a way to make it in the place that they are from as an UI/UX Designer.
