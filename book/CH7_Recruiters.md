## How to get 6 interviews in a week
One of the main issues with applying to jobs is the tedious and non productive way of applying via a job board such as Indeed, Ziprecuiter. The results can vary, depending on various factors such as the geolocation of where the job search is taking place.
 
### Applying via job board, rejection emails.

There's no surprise that there can be a lot of rejection when applying to jobs where there can be a lot of competition. Because some of these positions get 1000s of applications, the bulk of applicants will make it difficult to even be seen by a hiring manager.
 
If you have an excellent resume that will be picked up applying directly to these jobs, then this method should work eventually. Or if the competition isn't that high as there isn't much supply of applicants under 1000 applicants per listing, then getting hired via this method is much more likely. When in an industry with a lot of competition such as software engineering or computer science, there can be 1000s of applicants per position., also depending on the location such as San Francisco Bay Area / Silicon Valley.
 
## How using recruiters that found me via the profile on job boards
 
Get a resume together with lots of keywords.

Then upload the resume onto the top job boards. Such as Monster, Indeed, ZipRecuiter, Glassdoor, Linkedin, etc. Also look around for smaller job boards that are specialized to the design industry. Also applying directly to a recruiter such as Robert Half, Creative Circle, etc.
 
Once the resume is uploaded to the job board, depending on the platform they will generate a profile based on the resume. Make sure to have the visibility of the profile to be allowed to be viewed by others, such as potential employers, recruiters, etc.
 
Depending on the amount of keyboards, and making sure to have the job that you are pursuing related to certain professions, then recruiters will be able to find you and they are looking for you.
 
## Apply for jobs with recruiters
 
Get a secondary phone number because depending on how you plan to go forward, using a personal number can be an issue.
 
The main issue is that many of the jobs that you may or may not be interested in, there can be various reasons why the recruiters start their search but the reality is that a lot of this process is still done manually by people. For example there are hiring managers, and recruiters all try to find someone to fill in a position.

These people have a job that requires them to be fast, and so the reality of finding jobs is that, waking up earlier or at least being awake to be able to take calls is what is important. Also because the truth is that depending on how the day goes, usually these positions start doing interviews within a week or so.
 
So applying to these jobs will require someone to be able to take calls around 7AM PST or earlier. The calls start around then. So to be ready to take calls requires someone to be awake during earlier hours.
 
### Remote Jobs during Covid
 
One of the main things that have changed during Covid, is that companies are either now delaying the time for relocation, or they have changed their positions to 100% Remote indefinitely.
 
Because of this, there are actually a huge amount of opportunities for individuals that have skill sets, and are looking for a job. No matter where you are located, you can apply for jobs that are looking for remote workers.
 
If you are not interested in relocation, apply to the jobs that are looking for remote workers that do not have to relocate during the period of the contract, or that are looking for remote workers to work permanently full time 100% remote.
 
## 6 Interviews after a week of applying.
 
After taking around 20 calls per day, and working with recruiters who would send 5-10 applications per day. After a week of this process, after speaking to 100 recruiters, I was able to get around 6 interviews within a period of around 7 days.

The jobs are with companies that are diverse and across the united states, some of the positions are remote with relocation, while others are looking for 100% remote. Some are full time, w2 with benefits, short contracts are around 3-6 months, longer contracts are around 12 months - 18 months. The pay range is around 30/HR to 60/HR.
 
## Getting the job
 
Based on the results, 6 interviews per week, can do around 30 interviews per month, if you are able to do 100 interviews after 3 months, you just need a 1% success rate to get a job. One of the main difficulties of getting a job as an UI/UX Designer is that the competition is very high so it is sometimes difficult to get an interview.
 
With this method you can get 100 interviews in 3 months.
 
Getting the interview will require the resume to be at a certain place, for example sometimes there is a minimum number of years of experience.
 
After the resume, the portfolio will be another factor to actually get the job.
