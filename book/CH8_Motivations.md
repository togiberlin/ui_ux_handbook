# Motivation
This chapter is motivation for designers looking for design jobs.
 
Look.
 
This is a competitive industry. Sometimes things don't look good, and sometimes it is hard to find the motivation to continue on.
 
As a fellow designer, here is a pep talk that I hope will give you the motivation to continue on. I know that some in the industry are very crusty and it is tough to get through that tough skin you have developed over the years.
 
Maybe you have given up many times, after so many rejection, and even finding a design job you are realizing that it isn't as creative as you would have liked, you feel like your career should have been better and that there should have been more opportunities for you.
 
You find it harder and harder to work with your fellow designers, in the roles where the focus should be on the creative aspect and the designs.
 
You can do it. I believe in you and I believe in the design industry. I believe that designers can solve problems and that there will be continued room for growth.
 
It's tough to apply for jobs and it's tough to make it in this world, but if you believe in yourself and tough it out you can make it, I promise you.
 
Don't feel insecure with what you have accomplished and don't feel like you need to hoard the skills and experience you have gathered over the years. Yes, there is new and upcoming talent who seem like they are fresh and doing so well, compared to what?
 
We can share this industry, and build something for everyone, everyone can have a chance, the ones who care are the ones who make it to the top and then build a better world for the ones still making their journey.
 
That is my motivation for writing this book. When it was hard for me to make it, despite all the negativity and the doubters. That I also gave up sometimes because of the outside factors who pressured me day after day to cave in to their reality of what they envisioned for me.
 
I stuck to it though and as a designer that is the most important part of being a designer. Believing in yourself and not giving up.
 
I hope this will be motivation for the right person, who is always at a crossroad, looking for someone who believes in them.
 
I want to let you know that I believe in you as a fellow designer, that we can make it happen if we stick through it. And it may be so hard and difficult, although it could have been easier or harder for some, there are always times no matter who you are when you feel insecure about who you are.
 
Don't give up on yourself and don't give up on the design industry.

# Bad Jobs
 
## How to Deal with a Bad Job and How to deal with Negativity in the Workplace
 
When someone has a bad job, and they deal with negativity on a daily basis, they need to have the correct coping skills to get through the difficult times.
 
Using these as a way to cope rather than blowing up at home at home once youâ€™re back from work.
 
Why do you have a bad job?
 
How do I get a better job?
 
Why do I have this job? Did I choose this job? Do I have a choice?
 
About how you feel, you feel trapped, the reality is that you have freedom to get a new job, get a better job and become a better person.
 
For example the pay is good or good enough, so no matter how much they get paid, they still are not happy, because the work environment itself is negative.
 
A lot of times, people get trapped in their lifestyle and maintain a lifestyle.
 
A negative cycle where you can't quit your job because you have bills to pay because of financial decisions.
 
Stuck in a cycle of working for pay that basically is just taken the moment it touches the bank. The sacrifices that you didn't make, the lifestyle choices that you decided were not negotiable, or refusing to downsize, because of a previous lifestyle.
 
Everyday is a grind for what seems like no progress.
 
Everyday you go in to work, and every second is hell, its torture and everyday feels like a waste of your time.
 
After you come home from work, you are in a negative mood, because of your shitty job, which you have to do and which you have to work at and cant quit because of your lifestyle choices.
 
You come home after work, with this reality, everyday.
 
And you take it out on the people around you, the people that are home.
 
You shit on them, because of your shitty day at work.

### Negative Home Life
 
Negative Home Life -> Negative Feedback Loop -> Negative Work Environment
 
If you have a Negative Home Life, the only real solution is to leave or not be home as often.
 
Once you have a workplace that is positive then you can start solving problems at home.
 
And turn your home life into a positive home environment.
 
Positive Home Life, but because of negative work environments you eventually turned your home life into a negative place as well.
 
### How to deal with negative coworkers.
 
Always go to upper management. If you have a problem with management, the only solution is to leave the job.
 
### How to deal with a negative Boss.
 
The only solution is to leave the job.
 
### How to deal with a negative work environment.
 
The answer is that you just need to leave, and find something better.
 
The real answer is to get a better job.
 
### Is the work hard?
 
### Labor intensive? Is it physically difficult, is it mentally hard?
 
Or is it just ego, and it's just people not working together.
 
It might be more of a people problem.
 
Blanket statement, but usually it's related to bullying.
 
Coworkers bully each other, Bosses bully the lower tier workers, Clients bully the CS staff,
 
Culture of bullying.

# Regarding jobs and toxic work environments
 
Let's talk about jobs where for example you get paid an amount that's acceptable and you start working. And you start working at the work environment, and get the hang of the job, seeing the environment, seeing the people, seeing the clients, etc.
 
You spend some time there and you realize that for some reason itâ€™s not a really positive environment. Maybe itâ€™s the management, because the management isn't giving enough oversight or maybe they micromanage. They might not be very good management players, but they have a management position and they have a manager role.
 
Usually you can start from there and later find out it trickles down to the lower workers. You might realize one of the main reasons for that low morale: there's a lot of disrespect in the workplace, usually because of upper management.
 
A part of it could be related to labor. Maybe the quality of the workforce is actually low. They are willing to hire anyone willing to take the job. And because of that they hire people who have mental problems, or emotional problems. They might not have the best home life to come back to after work.
 
One of the main reasons why workers have low morale is usually because of a negative home life, and they bring their negativity to work. Then they bring that negativity back home.
 
From my personal experience, I had jobs where I really didn't want to be there and I was only there because of money. These jobs were usually related to labor, low skilled labor, there was no experience necessary, no education necessary.
 
Basically it wasn't a very good job, and the pay was low. Sometimes even when the pay is good. It doesn't matter, you forget about the money. Itâ€™s more like day to day.
 
Everyday it would feel like hell. I would feel like I was trapped in hell. And especially because the work would go so slowly hour by hour and it would be agonizing. Every second would be torture. That's how those jobs feel.
 
### One of the main things about this whole thing is that there are too many people who don't understand this, and they take it home with them.
 
Being unaware of what they are doing, and after getting out of work. Wake up and get to work. When at work it's not like we spend every single second doing work and being productive. You know what happens during this time?
 
A lot of the time we just sit there and wait. We just kill time, till the day is over. Being in that kind of a job is the worst feeling.
 
Because after that day is over, you feel like all you did was waste time, in a dead end job that really makes you think about your life a little.
 
Why did you choose to do certain things, why are you here, why do you have to do this job?
 
And you start thinking about how do I get out of here?
 
The reality is that these are jobs that you do, you get money and then you pay your bills. Thatâ€™s all. But after you get off that job, such a horrible feeling, just wondering where your day went. All gone.
 
Now we are talking about weeks, and then weekends. Really working for the weekend. When I got off work, I would be in a cranky mood. I would not be feeling good, I feel like a lot of my time is wasted, and I feel like the rest of my day is already over.
 
It makes me feel a certain way, and it was not a good feeling to be honest.
 
For what a couple hundred bucks?
 
Compound that with a hostile work environment, where your coworkers aren't supportive, and management isn't there for you when they need to be.
 
Then you come home, after that whole day at work. And youâ€™re in a bad mood after work, you might have wanted to get into arguments with your coworkers, but you didn't because you were trying to be respectful.
 
So you hold it all the whole day and when you go home, whoever is nearby will be the one who gets the one to suffer.
 
When I was a kid, my dad would come home from work in a terrible mood everyday, and the first thing he would do was take it out on me.
 
That is the part I didn't like.
 
Because I have been there a few times and I have also taken it out on people, as well taking it out on complete strangers. It's kind of sad actually.
 
So let's say you can't get out of your job for some reason. After you come home from work it's better to get it all out before you do come home. Because the people at home, it's not that they don't want to deal with it, because they care.
 
They care about you, but nobody wants to deal with that.
 
It needs to be something else, like it can be anything.
 
Maybe you have to take a walk after work.
 
For those people, if they come home from work in a bad mood and start taking it out on people. The people at home aren't going to appreciate it.
 
Itâ€™s going to cause problems at home, you are going to basically bring all your problems you have from work to home. It's going to cause a lot of the people around you to not like you.
 
But a lot of times, when people are that way and they come that way people don't like them.
 
The people that actually show up with negative attitudes after work, because of their job.
 
You need to find something else to deal with that stuff before you come home.
 
If you are able to create a barrier between you and your home, you can manage through it.
 
Because a job is temporary, you will get a new job eventually, you will get a better job, you will get paid better.
 
So you have to make sure to not bring that stuff from work to home. Or it's going to cause problems at home, and you are going to have a bigger mess than when you started your job.
 
Not only that, it changes people. Like a person, maybe they didn't have any mental or emotional problems because they didn't have to deal with it on a consistent basis.
 
Once they do the job for too long, it changes them and turns them into a negative person.
 
Unless you find a way to separate the negativity.
 
Don't take it home with you.
 
Take an hour, or take two hours and get it all out there, outside of work before you come home.
 
Then when you get home, it's like nothing ever happened.
 
That's what's important because the people at home have their own problems, they don't want to deal with. Also they are most likely not trying to bring that stuff home either, so if there is one person like that, it kind of makes it really annoying for everyone else that lives there.
 
Now here's the question: How do I get better, how do I improve from here?
 
Let's say you are stuck in a job.
 
Really the only solution is, and I hate to say this, you have to get a new job.
 
I know you think I can just work here, change it, make it better.
 
Unless your management, there's nothing you can do.
 
So unless you think you can get into a management position, and even if you are in a management position, you still need to have the respect of the people.
 
Or else you aren't going to be a good manager, so unless you think you can do that, there's no way you can fix the problem because it's too big.
 
There's no way you can fix it by yourself unfortunately.
 
The only solution is to leave that environment, I mean and here's the important part.
 
Keep this in mind.
 
Maybe you chose that job.
 
I know it's hard to accept it, especially when you think you need the job and that you need to make that money.
 
But didnt you really apply for that job, and didnt you really go for it? And wasn't there a time or a period of time when you were excited to start that job and you were positive and optimistic about it.
 
That optimism was incorrect, but the thing is I think there are jobs like that out there.
 
Where it's really a great environment to work at, you get paid like you get paid the same, does not have to be more. The only thing different now is that you don't have to deal with that negativity after work. And after work, you don't have to come home after work with a feeling because you don't have one.
 
You don't feel a certain way because your job doesn't suck.
 
Maybe the reason your job doesn't suck isn't because you're getting paid less.
 
Or doing a job that isn't important.
 
Maybe the job doesn't suck because the management doesn't suck, maybe the coworkers aren't negative.
 
Maybe they are positive people to be around, maybe they lift you up and help you.
 
Maybe the work environment is positive and the work you're doing is productive and fulfilling for you.
 
If you have a job like that, after you get off of work, you aren't going to feel a certain way.
 
That's how you know, and those are the jobs you need to look for. Those are the jobs that are hard to find.
 
Especially for people who are negative and they come out of an environment that is negative, it's really hard for them to change their ways, but those environments do exist.
 
And I highly suggest if you have a bad job currently, or you always had bad jobs, and you want something to change.
 
Like you want to get better, you want a better job, and you don't want to come home after work feeling like shit.
 
 
Because you feel like shit you take it out on people around you when you come home.
 
Instead of doing that a better idea might be.
 
During that interview process, I know the interview process. I know there's a lot of things about getting the highest pay possible, getting the highest rate possible.
 
But instead of being so focused on the rate, because to be honest it's going to be market rate anyways.
 
As long as they meet a certain minimum amount.
 
Instead of being so focused on that, what might be more important is to find a job, where you actually like working there.
 
And you are making a positive difference.
 
The most important part, this is how you will probably find out or probably know, is that you don't want the day to end because you want to do more work.
 
You don't want to go home because your workplace is better than your home life, because it's more positive for some reason.
 
Or the work is easy, actually it's been what you've been trying to do for so long. That you kind of want to work overtime because you want to put more hours in because you like to.
 
Thats such a big difference compared to the jobs where every single second is torture, and after you come home from work you are in such a bad mood.
 
So it's not really about the rate, I know alot times people hold out because they want to make more money.
 
The truth is that what is more important is to find a job that isn't going to cause you to become a negative person at the end of the day.
