# How to start with(out) good references
There are a few things employers look for when hiring designers for jobs. They look at the resume, the portfolio, credentials, as well as references.
 
A designer can prepare a resume, a portfolio and get credentials, but when you are someone that is starting out with few or no real references in the UX Design industry, because of no real job experience in UX or if the references are now old and irrelevant.
 
Even without references, a designer can apply for positions but without any real references it will be difficult because of the competition having references. Sometimes a good reference can make the difference between getting a job or not getting a job.
 
There are a few ways to get started, even with no references. For one, getting a job at any company, for any role will be a reference for another job. But ideally it is important that the reference is relevant to design.
 
Starting to apply for one piece contracts, or gig positions is a great place to start because, each of those contracts can turn into something greater, but as well as them becoming a reference for the work completed.
 
Sometimes contracts also ask for references, but when doing quick piece work, usually they will allow you to complete the piece as soon as possible and start work as soon as possible.
 
## Gigs: How to get fresh references to apply for full time positions
You are an up and coming artist, looking to make it into the design world, and then you realize you have no references. Don't fear, there is still a way to make it into the world. These are called gigs. Gigs can be small contracts, or just verbal contracts, that state that work was done, as well as if the gig was paid or unpaid.
 
Each of these Gigs could turn into more work, but for someone who doesn't have a reference, it is important to start with Gigs, to build up a client list of people whom you are working with or for, and then that reference list will be what is used when speaking to hiring managers at larger companies for full time positions.
 
### Where to find Gigs
Finding Gigs and finding Jobs are different
 
There are places where you can find jobs for example Indeed is a good place to find jobs.
 
There are places to find gigs for example:
 
These are freelancer websites where you can start building out a profile to apply for gigs, and start doing gigs that are related to UX Design. But you will need to compete against other freelancers, and these freelancers are from across the world, and they do good work for cheaper.
 
Freelancer.com
 
Fiverr.com
 
Upwork.com is a website that is slightly better and only accepts us applicants.
 
The high end of the freelancer websites is Topal, which also only accepts USA applicants.
 
#### Free Gigs
To find gig leads for free you can also search Craigslist, to find leads for people looking for gigs across the USA. That was how I got started in UX Design, doing Gigs for people on Craigslist.
 
Eventually built out a Lead Generator and Mail Automation System where it would scrap all leads from craigslist and automatically apply to all those gigs.
 
https://github.com/jaeminkim-com/cl_scrapper
 
Using this system, I was able to create information on how a portfolio will influence the likelihood of a client moving forward with a project/gig.

# FANNG

## Overview (USA)
FAANG are tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet (Google).

## Getting interviews for FAANG
The UX Designers who are located in areas with high level tech companies, such as San Francisco Bay Area / Silicon Valley / San Jose / Los Angeles / New York City / Portland, etc. 

Getting interviews at these companies is pretty easy, as long as you are located in the area. If you are not located in the area, then applying for these positions will be more difficult, but you can still apply for remote positions, but they may expect you to be able to come in to the physical location occasionally. If you are located outside of the USA, then applying for these positions will be very difficult.

1. You need to be here in the area that you apply for, so for example you need to live in the Silicon Valley to apply for companies in the Silicon Valley. And the Silicon Valley is known for FANNG. 

2. You need to be at a certain quality of skill level, as well as experience and correct credentials related to safely practice, as well as professionalism.

## Recruiters

### Getting recruiters to contact you based on keywords, etc. Once a profile is built out recruiters will contact you.

![Welcome](../../../files/img/recruiters.png)

### When applying to jobs try to find recuiters that work internally for the company that the job is being offered from. This way you will be able to talk directly to the people who will be able to get you the position.

![Welcome](../../../files/img/re-01.png)

### Example of recruiter that works for an outside hiring company. getting a job from a recruiter that works through a hiring company will get a part of your salary as pay, also because they don't work at the company that is offering the job it will be a different process.

# Chapter 9: Getting Design Job Secret

## How do I get a designer job when I have no experience?
### How do I get a job when I have no experience?
#### I apply to 1000s of jobs but never get a reponse why?
#### Why dont recruiters contact me back?
#### Why dont companies contact me for interviews?

Are these questions you are constantly asking yourself? Let me tell you how it is. 

## The Cream 
The designer cream, is one which starts early, before high school. Do you remember the kids that had rubix cubes in high shool? Those kids became programmers. They applied to the best colleges and got into the best majors and now have a selection of the jobs they can get. They get multiple offers, and yes they will leave a job to get a better job, so after they leave the position opens up again. Be aware of the competition and be aware of the cream.

## The rest of us
OK, so you are not from the perfect background, for example maybe you had to work right after high school or maybe you got to start working labor jobs at 16. Or maybe you do have a background but you were the kid that had to work federal work studies and lets just say your meal plan wasent perfect.

## The Secret
Here is the secret.

Because I have been there as well, in a place where it wasent pretty and it was pretty depressing. It seemed as if everyone had experience and I had nothing. Because it was true, I was not ready for the work that is required to become a designer. The main problem is the skill level is just not there, and even if there was a huge talent, it would have to be molded into something that can be productive.

The secret is this.

Create a website, a portfolio website, and start becoming a remote contractor for design. Apply for design positions remotely, apply for gigs, and start getting paid for small piece work. Slowly add these into your online portfolio and see how year after year how it grows.

For example:

My portfolio website is www.jaeminkim.com, and it is my remote contractor website.

I have been keeping track of how long I have been working on this portfolio website and as myself as a remote contractor.

Sometimes the work was not consitent, and I did work various other jobs not related to design, which will not be on my design resume.

The first year will be difficult, especially if you have bills to pay. Do not expect to be able to cover everything by working as a designer.

Instead focus and go on even if things dont go your way.

Keep it up and keep looking for more gigs, and keep improving your portfolio.

The second year, you will be able to see more progress.

Now the third year, fourth year, and even fifth year.

Now all of a sudden you have put 5 years into yourself as a designer, with your own portfolio website and a list of client work that was paid, and now you see that all of a sudden you do have experience.

You have 5 years of experience as a remote contractor designer.

Now using this experience you will have a real chance to get a job, because although it wasent the most docuemented job, you can still put it as something you did.

From here on, it will get ALOT easier to apply for jobs, and gigs.

Once you are here you will be able to apply to the jobs that normal people are applying to, for example more full time positions, etc.

This is the way to go if you arn't part of the design cream.

But remember that 5 years without making progress with clients, or if your portfolio is not amazing after 5 years, then it might have more to do with a lack of skill, than lack of trying.

## Conclusion

It's alot to ask someone to really struggle and build out something for themselves without much financial help. Additionally facing the reality of having to support your ambitions of being a designer. Some do not have that luxury, and for some even trying to make this happen for themselves is a difficult journey.

This is the designer journey, unless you had support to go to the best art colleges in the country, and you were able to concentrate on your studies and you graduated. But even then, you will be suprised to see the number of graduates that still dont have design jobs.

Because of this reason. Once you have 5 years of experience as your own remote contractor with your own portfolio, you will be seen next to the cream. The cream have the best credentials, and sometimes even the best experience of internship while they were in school.

But now they will actually look at you and give you a chance. So if you have a portfolio now that is actually better than the ones that come out of the art schools, because you have paid client work for example, even if that work was done for 20 dollars, is still client work, you because of that a portfolio filled with paid client work is actually better than a student portfolio with only personal and student projects.

So this means now you will be able to compete against the cream, and the only way to show that you have the stuff is with a portfolio.

When your portfolio is better than the rest of the competition you will get the job over someone with better credentials. This is common is places with less restriction, such as in the art and the design fields.

If you are willing to put in that time and that work.. then you can become a designer. If you are not willing to do this kind of work, you can apply for art college and try to have the word UX in your major, please.

At the end of the day, when you do have this portfolio that you have built out over several years, and the quality is there, you can start seeing people respond based on the portfolio alone.

Now if you have the resume with your contractor position on your resume.

For example mine is this:

Remote UX Designer
Company Name jaeminkim.com Contract
Dates EmployedNov 2016 – Present
Employment Duration4 yrs 9 mos
LocationSan Francisco Bay Area
• Designed User Interface and User Experience Designs for Clients across the United States and Canada.
• Maintained Websites and Web Servers, with HTML/CSS/JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, React.JS.
• Accomplished design tasks using Adobe Illustrator and XD, and produced design assets.

With this part in the resume, recruiters can consider this as experience that can replace a college degree.

The important part is that the portfolio needs to be stellar. 

Here is my current resume, as you can see there is a section where it states that there was experience as a remote independent contractor, and then it lists out the clients that were worked for during that time.
