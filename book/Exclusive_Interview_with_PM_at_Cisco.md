### Interview
 
John:
 
"So what's your current role at your current company?"
 
IT Project Manager at Cisco
 
Javier:
 
"Project Manager, IT Project Manager."
 
John:
 
"At Cisco?"
 
Javier:
 
"Yeh."
 
John:
 
"So, how'd you get there from the program from Yearup?"
 
Javier:
 
"A Lot of Networking, really, just talking to people.
 
After the internship was over, I couldn't keep working as desk support
 
so I started talking to
 
there was a VP, that gave a talk to the YearUp folk
 
he said he seemed really cool and I reached out to him again afterwards the talk
 
and I asked him because I knew that he was closer to project management, i asked him if i could get into that if i could learn if i could follow someone shadow someone so i can know how to become an Project Manager
 
So from there I started doing it started helping the project managers there and then they liked my work they offered a position
 
John:
 
And this was on Ebay?
 
Javier:
 
Yeh this was at ebay
 
John;
 
and then from ebay you went to paypal?
 
Javier:
 
yep
 
John:
 
and you kept your position as a project manager ?
 
Javier:
 
I was just a project coordinator then, I wasn't a project manager yet. I was helping the project managers. Helping build the spreadsheets, tracking projects, asking the engineers, reporting back to project managers.
 
John:
 
And then you went on to work at Google?
 
Javier:
 
Everything so far has been contractor. I am 100% at ebay, google and paypal, but i'm not on their payroll.
 
John:
 
At Cisco, this was the role that was remote. This is a remote contractor position.
 
Javier:
 
As far as the position goes, the PM, a lot of positions like engineering, is about experience, so I leverage my experience from previous experience to get to the following companies.
 
John:
 
What kind of tools do they use internally for some of these Tech Companies?
 
Javier:
 
What do you mean?
 
John:
 
Like a custom tool, or like Salesforce?
 
Javier:
 
These companies are huge. We are talking about 30,000-40,000 people.
 
Remity is something we use to track ticketing.
 
Smartsheets for tracking.
 
Puppet
 
John:
 
Is there one tool that you just found useful as a PM?
 
Javier:
 
Smartsheets. It's like Microsoft Project. You can set milestones and tasks and dependencies, so that if you move one of the tasks, it's really simple.
 
JohnJ:
 
What kind of responsibility did you have at some of these tech companies, at the remote position?
 
Javier:
 
Building different softwares, tracking the build of the software, tracking it and engineers have what they need to be successful.
 
If we are building an application for a specific client we need to know what is going  on with the build, it's difficult for the engineers to focus on coding and also manage conversations with stakeholders and leadership, thats where come in to manage those conversations we if anything is anything late or clarifying questions
 
John:
Overall what kind of experience was that like? Was it a positive experience?
 
Javier:
 
It was overall positive, very chill.
 
John:
 
As a PM that comes from a design background. The reality is that the tech industry is more tech oriented so there are more technical details.
 
But were there ever opportunities to be creative and use design while working as a PM in the tech industry?
 
Javier:
 
There is a lot of stuff like design, I will fire up Illustrator or Photoshop, to modify icons or mockups I want to build for the client that we're working with, so we're all on the same page.
 
We could be describing. I want this home page to have this button here that will take us to a certain part of the database.
 
I would use something like an illustrator to mock that up.
 
John:
 
So that interaction you described, of going to that database, before that interface is there, before you draw something, that ideating that interface.
 
Javier:
 
We already have an application we are building a portal, where the client reference different databases and create a dashboard where they can look and digest the data, and graphs, and smaller tables that would automatically that feed from databases,
 
So if we are building that, and we want to click over here do w4e want a drop down of object A, or do we click object A and see all the dashboard and we will break it down from there.
 
So big companies have a lot of data they have to work with, even just to know where their servers are. We have over 20,000 servers, 30,000 servers, how do we determine which server goes bad, which server needs to be rebrushied what is the health of those servers?
 
What's the plan?
 
Huge teams just work on the database, every base has finance and HR, and design teams determine where we need a server, where are those people going to work from, if we are going to have designers all over the world we need to have servers or there will be a huge latency.
 
John:
 
What is the most important thing to getting and keeping a job at a top tier tech company?
 
Javier:
 
Don't get too comfortable. Make sure that always eager to help, got to be self driven, if they don't give you a project, start looking into use free time, and look into different things that are going on
 
So when talking to your manager, do you think we can go into a meeting where we can talk about refreshing the main page of [Cisco.com](http://cisco.com) ?
 
And you are interested in that, because they want to know that you're interested in what you're doing.
 
Otherwise if you don't show no interest at all and you just go in and clock in and start browsing the internet all day you will end up eating the dust.
 
John:
 
What are some PROS and CONS of being a contractor and being an employee?
 
Javier:
 
So you don't get the benefits of the company, if you're not an employee, so you don't get that. And then the reason is cheaper to hire a contractor, if a company wants to get a new employee they need to plan out how to pay that employee for 5 years. For most companies it's like that.
 
But for contractors for quarterly basis, ok i need contractors for this quarter which is three months, i need someone to build this, i need engineers, they can bring them in as contractors, and its alot easier and less paperwork for them, and also they don't need to pay anyone benefits
 
John:
 
What are some PROS of being a COntractor? Getting the contract is OK.
 
Javier:
 
I mean your employees, you get money coming in. I also heard you made more money as a contractor than as an employee. But I don't know if it's true, in my opinion.
 
John:
 
What are some COns of being an employee? Getting stuck or getting too comfortable?
 
Javier:
 
Employees have to do quarterly performance reviews, they would have to write up everything they did, and that could get annoying.
 
John:
 
What are the strategies that worked as a remote worker?
 
Javier:
 
It depends on which position, as a salesman it could be hard to sell stuff remotely, it's all about building a relationship with a client and it's difficult with a webcam or just a phone. If you are doing UX work, I feel like bigger companies should worry too much, if we were talking to grad students, someone just coming out of college.
 
You shoulnt worry too much about building huge things or making a humongous impact when going in. Because usually you will just be doing what your manager will be telling you to do. Which is, can you just go over there and follow the guidelines and make the dashboard look like that, and get the icons and make them all match.
 
John:
 
That is literally what designers would do.
 
Javier:
 
That is going to happen at the lower level, when you become a senior designer, and become a director of design. You will make big decisions, such as what should [cisco.com](http://cisco.com) look like. What are the coolest things, what will bring the most eyes to this website? This is a more difficult question. They leave that to seniors.
 
John:
 
Did you have a design Journey, did you have a hero's journey, did the PM journey?
 
Javier:
 
I've definitely switched over time, I've focused on going up to senior management or VP level, eventually. Trying to aim for that, either the lead of PMO, project management office, alot of big companies have different project management officer, that takes care of all the other project managers bellow.
 
To become a Vice President of the department.
 
John:
 
So the PM has become a larger part of your journey?
 
Javier:
 
Yeh about Project Management, you can become part of the development, you can see the design of the product, and you can see the big picture, it's a lot of resource management.
 
So you have 5 engineers they can work 5 days a week, so that 5 days a week they are available to do someone so you need someone for them to do for 5 days
 
So we go to the backlog of stuff, and get the pipelines, and get the things to make it happen
 
So I get create that resource and plan and I tell them what to do during that sprint
 
John:
 
So there are software engineers, developers, designers, so how does that dynamic work out? Do you guys ever fight?
 
Javier:
 
No we dont fight, especially in bigger companies, everyone is very professional there. At smaller companies, I worked for smaller companies,
 
John:
 
Like a startup
 
Javier:
 
Not really because it was 3000 people still, because usually you don't need a project manager unless your companies are really big. Project manager is an arm of the manager, because the manager will manage 20 projects.
 
They won't be able to see the projects, it's like a warehouse. They can't manage 100 projects and they can't talk to 500 people. it's humanly impossible. so they get project managers like us to manage those projects for them, and they talk to us, and we tell them about the project, and we tell them which engineers are doing well, or not.
 
John:
 
Are latinos and latinas underrepresented in the tech industry?
 
Javier:
 
If you are asking if there are less latinos than are represented in the population then do you think it is lower? What causes that is another question, there are a lot of factors that can go into it, racism is definitely one of them.
 
John:
 
Disciminiation? Do you think?Maybe disciminiation? DO you think? Based on skin color and race?
 
Javier:
 
I feel like there are alot of cliques, like if there are alot of Indians on a team , or a lot of Asians, or a lot of whites, they tend to clique and help each other and protect each other. But then they. If someone is not of their culture then they don't protect them as much, and they throw them under the bus, so if anything goes wrong that the one they use as the scapegoat, so it depends on the team you join, it's sad but its the world we live in.
 
John:
 
Why won't they pay benefits to contractors?
 
Javier:
 
Because it's cheaper to not do it.
 
John:
 
So do you think your expectations were fulfilled for your career and life? From a design background, do you some of the expectations were met and exceeded, where there any that wasn't met ye,
 
Javier:
 
I would have to do a masters to get those positions. If you don't have schooling, it's hard to get in there. It's harder to get in without it.
 
John:
 
SOmething motivational to say to someone just starting out in their journey?
 
Javier:
 
Keep on working on your portfolio build it out don't be afraid to mingle, always ask for openings, doesn't have to be all job, it could be an internship, it will be easier than applying through the website, you will be bundled into with 2000 other people, it will be easier to be chosen.
